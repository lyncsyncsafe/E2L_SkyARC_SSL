# CHANGELOG

> Complete history of the KIRO ISO project — newest first. Each entry explains not just what changed, but why it was done and what benefit it brings. Daily rebuilds (version bump + mirrorlist refresh only) are grouped into a single line.

## 2026.07.19

### Add two new X11 window-manager editions: **dusk** and **hlwm**

Promoted from the beta ISO (`kiro-iso-next`) after validation. The ISO Builder (KIB)
auto-discovers the editions it can bake from the `EDITION-BLOCK` markers in
**`archiso/packages.x86_64`**; comparing that list against **ATT's** desktop picker
(`desktopr.py`, the canonical reference the build scripts already cite) surfaced exactly
two X11 window managers ATT can install but the ISO could not bake in — **dusk** (a
dwm-fork, `kiro-dusk`, ships its own `xsessions/dusk.desktop`) and **herbstluftwm**
(`kiro-hlwm`, session file supplied by Arch's `herbstluftwm` package).

- **`archiso/packages.x86_64`** — two new commented `EDITION-BLOCK`s. Both follow the
  existing lean convention (the same core the chadwm/bspwm/leftwm blocks use, not ATT's
  fuller utility set): `dusk` mirrors the chadwm block with `kiro-dusk` swapped in and no
  `sxhkd`; `hlwm` uses that same core plus the herbstluftwm/polybar stack
  (`kiro-hlwm herbstluftwm kiro-polybar polybar`), matching how bspwm/leftwm carry polybar.
- **`build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh`** — `apply_editions()` maps `hlwm → herbstluftwm` in
  the `sddm_session` `case` (alongside the existing `budgie → budgie-desktop`), because the
  live-ISO autologin session basename is `herbstluftwm.desktop`, not `hlwm`. `dusk` needs no
  mapping — its session file already matches the edition name.
- **`build-scripts/build.conf.defaults`** — the `# Available:` edition list now includes
  `dusk` and `hlwm`.
- **Why:** users building a Kiro ISO can now bake a Dusk or Herbstluftwm session directly,
  closing the gap with what ATT already offers post-install. KIB needs no code change —
  `functions.py :: list_editions()` discovers the new blocks automatically.

## 2026.06.30

### Add `version_override` knob — forward/back-date a release without faking the clock

`apply_version_bump` (Phase 2) always derived the version from `date +%y.%m.%d`, so an
ISO built today could only ever be stamped with today's date. To build a release ahead
of time (e.g. cut the **v26.07.01** monthly ISO a day early), there was no clean option
short of `faketime`-ing the whole build.

- New **`version_override`** setting in **`build-scripts/build.conf`** (and the tracked
  `build.conf.defaults`). Empty = unchanged behaviour (use today's date). Set to a
  `vYY.MM.DD` string = stamp that exact version everywhere the bump touches (dev-rel
  `ISO_RELEASE`, `build-the-iso.sh` `kiroVersion`, profiledef `iso_label` + `iso_version`).
- Only applies on the **`bump_version=yes`** path. A malformed value fails loudly with a
  clear error instead of producing a garbage ISO name.
- The internal build-date stamp (`ISO_BUILD` in `/etc/dev-rel`, Phase 10) is left alone:
  it still records the real moment of the build, so version can be forward-dated while
  build provenance stays honest.
- **Why:** monthly/scheduled releases can now be built when there's time and labelled with
  the release date, with one config line instead of a clock hack.

**Technical Details** — added the override branch + a `^v[0-9]{2}\.[0-9]{2}\.[0-9]{2}$`
format guard in `apply_version_bump`; `verify_version_sync` (Phase 3) is unchanged and
still confirms all four files carry the resolved version.

**Files Modified** — `build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh`, `build-scripts/build.conf.defaults`,
`build-scripts/build.conf` (live copy, also set to `v26.07.01` for this build).

## 2026.06.28

### Complete the fish default: ship `starship`, `kiro-starship` and `fish-tweak-tool`

The 2026.06.26 change switched the live `liveuser` login shell to fish; it left the prompt
unstyled and unmanaged. These three additions to **`archiso/packages.x86_64`** round out the
fish experience for the **v26.07.01** monthly release:
- **`starship`** — the cross-shell prompt engine (added after `ripgrep-all`).
- **`kiro-starship`** — Kiro's `starship.toml` preset, shipped both to `/etc/skel/.config/` and
  as the `/usr/share/kiro/starship/` default that **`fish-tweak-tool`** reads.
- **`fish-tweak-tool`** — the GTK tool for switching the prompt/preset and managing fish from a
  GUI (added next to `fastfetch-tweak-tool`).
- **Why:** with a styled Starship prompt and a GUI to tweak it, the first official monthly ISO
  ships fish as a finished default rather than a bare login-shell swap.

## 2026.06.27

### Add **`seahorse`** (keyring management GUI)

Added **`seahorse`** ("Passwords and Keys") to **`archiso/packages.x86_64`**, in the
desktop-integration section next to **`gnome-keyring`**. It is the companion GUI to
gnome-keyring and lets users inspect and — crucially — change their **Login keyring
password**. This matters because Kiro uses SDDM **autologin**: no password is typed
at login, so PAM can never unlock a password-protected login keyring. Chromium-based
browsers (Vivaldi, Brave) store their secure key (`v11`) in that keyring, so when the
keyring stays locked — especially after switching desktop environments — the browser
fails to decrypt with *"Decryption Failed: Risk of Data Loss"*. Setting the Login
keyring password to blank via seahorse makes gnome-keyring store it in plaintext and
auto-unlock it transparently in every session (verified against a cold daemon start),
fixing the breakage without any autostart or launcher changes.

### Harden the colors block against a junk `TERM` (tput abort)

When the ISO Builder GUI runs `build-the-iso.sh` it does so under a PTY, so the
script's `[[ -t 1 ]]` test is true and it calls `tput`. On a desktop session that
exports a junk terminal type (`TERM=unknown`, reported on Arch + MATE), `tput setaf`
errors and — under the script's `set -euo pipefail` — kills the whole build at
startup with `tput: unknown terminal "unknown"`. The colors block now also probes
`tput setaf 1 >/dev/null 2>&1`; if that fails it falls through to the empty-string
fallback instead of aborting. The real GUI-side fix (forcing a sane `TERM`) lives in
`kiro-iso-builder`; this is defense-in-depth for anyone running the script directly.

- **`build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh`** — colors guard gains `&& tput setaf 1 >/dev/null 2>&1`.

## 2026.06.26

> **Milestone:** from **2026/07/01** Kiro ships **one official ISO per month**; **v26.07.01** is the first official monthly release. The bash → fish shell switch below is its headline change. v26.06.26 itself is a daily build, not the official release.

### Default shell: live `liveuser` switched bash → fish
- **`archiso/airootfs/etc/passwd`**: the `liveuser` login shell (field 7) changed from
  `/bin/bash` to `/bin/fish`, so booting the live ISO drops into fish. Root stays on bash.
  Only the shell field changes — the `x` placeholder and the (blank) password are untouched;
  `/etc/passwd` is the account table, not the password store.
- **Why:** align the out-of-box experience with fish as Kiro's default interactive shell. The
  matching `config.fish` already ships in `/etc/skel/.config/fish/` via **`kiro-fish-config`**
  (which also `depends=('fish')`), so PATH (`~/.bin`/`~/.local/bin`), aliases, prompt colors and
  helper functions are all in place — no regression. `.bashrc`/`.zshrc` still ship, so
  `tobash`/`tozsh` switch back in one command.
- Path `/bin/fish` chosen to match Kiro's existing convention (the `tofish` alias, the replaced
  `/bin/bash`); on Arch `/bin` → `/usr/bin` so it's identical to `/usr/bin/fish`.
- **Paired with** the installed-system half in **`kiro-calamares-config`** (`users.conf`
  `shell: /bin/fish`). Plan/decision record: `KIRO-PROJECTS/kiro-iso/bash-to-fish-conversion.md`.

### Shells: `kiro-shells` → meta-package + skel `.bashrc` repointed to `kiro-bash-config`
- The monolithic **`kiro-shells`** package was split into three per-shell packages —
  **`kiro-bash-config`**, **`kiro-zsh-config`**, **`kiro-fish-config`**. `kiro-shells`
  keeps its name and is now a **meta-package** depending on all three, so the package list
  and existing installs migrate transparently. **`archiso/packages.x86_64`** gains the
  three explicitly (alpha order) alongside the retained `kiro-shells`.
- The ISO bakes the skel `.bashrc` a second way, independent of the package: **`up.sh`**
  and **`build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh`** copy `.bashrc-latest` straight into
  `airootfs/etc/skel/.bashrc`. That logic was **repointed from `kiro-shells` to
  `kiro-bash-config`** — both the local path and the raw-GitHub `wget` URL. Docs
  (`README.md`, `docs/OVERVIEW.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) updated to match; the CLAUDE.md fetch
  line also corrected from the stale `erikdubois/` org to `kirodubes/`.

### Add: `intel-media-driver` + `pacman-contrib` (clean-CachyOS comparison)
- Added **`intel-media-driver`** to the **GRAPHICS / XORG** block of **`archiso/packages.x86_64`**,
  right after `mesa`. A live comparison against a clean CachyOS install surfaced that Kiro shipped
  no VA-API driver for Intel iGPUs: AMD/Radeon get VA-API through `mesa`, but Intel hardware needs
  `intel-media-driver` (Broadwell/Gen8 and newer) explicitly. Without it, Intel laptops fall back to
  software video decode — higher CPU, worse battery, choppier playback. CachyOS ships it by default;
  now so does Kiro.
- Added **`pacman-contrib`** to the **PACKAGE / SYSTEM TOOLS** block (alphabetically, after
  `namcap`). It provides `paccache` (cache cleanup), `checkupdates` (safe update check without
  touching the sync db), `pactree`, and `rankmirrors` — utilities multiple Kiro helper scripts and
  everyday maintenance lean on. CachyOS ships it; Kiro did not.
- Mirrored to `kiro-iso-next` the same day.

## 2026.06.25

### Fix: ISO build failed on `broadcom-wl-dkms` against kernel 7.1
- Pinned **`broadcom-wl-dkms`** to the cachyos repo in **`archiso/packages.x86_64`** — the entry is
  now written as **`cachyos/broadcom-wl-dkms`**.
- **What was breaking:** during the `mkarchiso` chroot stage, DKMS tried to build the Broadcom `wl`
  module against `linux-cachyos 7.1.1` and failed with `incompatible function pointer types` on
  `.get_station`, `.add_key`, `.del_key` and `.get_key`. Kernel 7.1's cfg80211 ops changed those
  callbacks to take `struct wireless_dev *` instead of `struct net_device *`, and the unmaintained
  Broadcom `wl` source still uses the old signatures.
- **Why pinning fixes it:** `[extra]` is listed before `[cachyos]` in **`archiso/pacman.conf`**,
  and pacman resolves a bare package name from the *first* repo in config order that provides it —
  not the highest version. So the build kept pulling Arch extra's pkgrel `-47`, which lacks a
  kernel-7.1 patch, while cachyos's pkgrel `-49` (which carries `022-linux71.patch`) sat unused at
  the bottom of the list. Repo-qualifying the single package forces the patched cachyos build without
  reordering the whole repo precedence — keeping the deliberate Arch-first ordering for every other
  package on the ISO.

## 2026.06.24

### Decision: keep the KDE Plasma Welcome Center on the live ISO
- **No change made.** Considered suppressing the KDE **Welcome Center** (`plasma-welcome`)
  that pops up on first login of the live Plasma session, then deliberately decided to **leave it
  as-is**.
- The intended mechanism — an autostart override (`~/.config/autostart/plasma-welcome.desktop`
  with `Hidden=true`) — would have belonged here in **`archiso/airootfs/etc/skel/.config/autostart/`**,
  since the live `liveuser` home derives from `/etc/skel` and that same skel is unpacked to the
  install target (so one file would have covered both the live session and every installed user). It
  was briefly scoped against `kiro-calamares-config`, but that repo only runs at install time and
  cannot touch the live session shown to the user, so the skel route was the correct home.
- **Why keep it:** the Welcome Center is standard upstream Plasma behaviour and harmless on a live
  ISO; suppressing it was judged not worth the extra shipped file. Recording the decision here so the
  next person who notices the pop-up knows it is intentional and not an oversight. Revisit only if it
  becomes a support nuisance.

### Phase-1 connectivity probe now retries before failing the build
- Reworked the connectivity check in **`build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh`** (Phase 1). The probe
  for `https://archlinux.org` and `https://github.com` previously ran a single shot
  (`wget --spider --timeout=10 --tries=1`) and called `exit 1` on the first miss. It now retries
  each host up to **3 times** with a **3s** pause between attempts, and the per-attempt timeout was
  raised **10s → 15s**. Only when all attempts to a host fail does the build abort.
- **Why:** a single transient network hiccup — a slow TLS handshake to github.com over the 10s
  window, a momentary DNS blip, one dropped packet — was enough to hard-fail the build at Phase 1,
  before any real work. Each abort left the root-owned `kiro-build` work dir behind, so the
  `kiro-iso-builder` GUI then prompted to remove it (requiring the sudo password) before a manual
  restart. In practice it took three retry cycles before github answered inside the single-try
  window. The retry loop absorbs these blips so a momentarily flaky connection no longer triggers
  the whole remove-folder-and-re-authenticate dance; a genuinely-down network still fails, just a
  few seconds later.

## 2026.06.23

### Remove obsolete `kiro-neo-candy-*` packages
- Dropped five lines from **`packages.x86_64`**: **`kiro-neo-candy-arc`**,
  **`kiro-neo-candy-arc-mint-grey`**, **`kiro-neo-candy-arc-mint-red`**, **`kiro-neo-candy-qogir`**
  and **`kiro-neo-candy-tela`**.
- **Why:** these packages no longer exist in the repos after the candy package set was reworked, so
  `mkarchiso` failed the install root with `target not found` for each one and aborted the build.
  Removing the stale references unblocks the build.

### Drop `vim` from the default package list
- Removed the **`vim`** line from **`packages.x86_64`**. **`nano`** stays as the lightweight default
  terminal editor, so the ISO still ships an editor out of the box.
- **Why:** vim is not wanted in the default Kiro install. With it installed, running `vim` in a
  terminal made **Konsole** show vim's icon on its taskbar entry (Konsole mirrors the foreground
  program's icon), which read as "vim pinned itself to the panel." Dropping the package removes both
  the install and that taskbar artifact. Affects the next build only; no builder code change.

## 2026.06.21

### Three more Surfn Plasma icon variants in the builder
- Extended the **`### CATEGORY: Plasma — Icons`** EXTRA-APP group in **`packages.x86_64`** with three
  additional Surfn Plasma icon themes served from **`nemesis_repo`**: **`surfn-plasma-dark-breeze-icons`**
  (Surfn Plasma Dark Breeze), **`surfn-plasma-dark-qogir-icons`** (Surfn Plasma Dark Qogir) and
  **`surfn-plasma-dark-tela-icons`** (Surfn Plasma Dark Tela). The Plasma — Icons section now exposes the
  full six-package Surfn family: Dark, Dark Breeze, Dark Qogir, Dark Tela, Light and Flow.
- **Why:** `nemesis_repo` ships six `surfn-plasma-*` icon packages but the builder only surfaced three —
  the three dark base-style variants (Breeze/Qogir/Tela re-coloured for the Surfn dark look) were missing,
  so users couldn't pick them from the **"Plasma extras"** page. Each new block carries the `| plasma`
  scope field and ships commented-out (opt-in); auto-discovered by the Kiro ISO Builder, no builder code
  change. All six package names verified present in the `nemesis_repo` sync database.

## 2026.06.20

### Plasma extras in the ISO builder — config, themes & icons
- Brought the **Plasma EXTRA-APP** section of **`packages.x86_64`** into sync with `kiro-iso-next`.
  These plasma-scoped opt-in blocks were tested on the beta ISO and are now ported to production:
  - **`### CATEGORY: Plasma`** — the six `kiro-plasma-*` config packages (`kiro-plasma-dolphin`,
    `-keybindings`, `-konsole`, `-servicemenus`, `-system-settings`, `-window-management`).
  - **`### CATEGORY: Plasma — Themes`** — `kiro-plasma-sweet` (the complete Sweet Plasma global
    theme), the four further Kiro Plasma global themes `kiro-plasma-layan`, `kiro-plasma-nord`,
    `kiro-plasma-whitesur` and `kiro-plasma-win11`, and `surfn-plasma-flow` (Surfn Flow theme).
  - **`### CATEGORY: Plasma — Icons`** — `surfn-plasma-dark-icons` and `surfn-plasma-light-icons`.
- **Why:** these only make sense on a Plasma build, so each block carries the optional 4th marker
  field `| plasma` that scopes it to the Plasma edition. The Kiro ISO Builder reads the scope and
  shows them on a dedicated **"Plasma extras"** page that appears only when Plasma is ticked
  (nothing ticked by default). All served from **`nemesis_repo`**; auto-discovered, no builder code
  change. `apply_package_additions()` matches by key and ignores the new field, so the build is
  unchanged and a standard Plasma build with nothing ticked is byte-for-byte unaffected.
- After this port the two `packages.x86_64` lists differ only by their intended divergences: the
  header banner and the six `-next`/`-nemesis` beta-suffix package swaps.
- **Note:** `kiro-plasma-sweet` is the renamed-from-`kiro-sweet` package; the EXTRA-APP entry uses
  the new name and will resolve once that package is rebuilt under `kiro-plasma-sweet` into
  `nemesis_repo`.

### Surfn icon sets — recategorised and correctly named
- **`packages.x86_64`** — moved the `surfn-plasma-flow` EXTRA-APP block out of
  **`### CATEGORY: Plasma — Themes`** and into **`### CATEGORY: Plasma — Icons`**: it is an icon
  set (an Erik original), not a global theme, and belongs with its siblings.
- Renamed all three Surfn icon sets to their real names so they are recognisable in the builder's
  Plasma extras page: `Surfn Dark icons` → **Surfn Plasma Dark**, `Surfn Light icons` →
  **Surfn Plasma Light**, `Surfn Flow theme` → **Surfn Plasma Flow**.
- Display-label and category only — the package keys (`surfn-plasma-dark-icons`,
  `surfn-plasma-light-icons`, `surfn-plasma-flow`) are untouched, so the build is unaffected.

## 2026.06.19

### Branded Kiro GRUB boot theme
- Added a Kiro-branded GRUB2 theme, shipped as the new **`kiro-grub-theme`** package (built into `nemesis_repo`, source repo `kirodubes/kiro-grub-theme`). It is a rebrand of the actively-maintained [vinceliuice/grub2-themes](https://github.com/vinceliuice/grub2-themes) (GPL-3.0) — the same family Kiro already referenced via Vimix — with a dark 1920×1080 background carrying the **Kiro logo + KIRO wordmark**, the full colour OS-icon set, and a custom **`kiro.png`** icon for the install entries.
- **`packages.x86_64`** — added `kiro-grub-theme` so the theme lands on installed systems.
- **`airootfs/etc/default/grub`** — repointed `GRUB_THEME` from `/boot/grub/themes/Vimix/theme.txt` to `/boot/grub/themes/kiro/theme.txt`. The old Vimix path was **dangling** (no package ever shipped `/boot/grub/themes/Vimix`), so installed BIOS systems previously got no GRUB theme at all — this fixes that latent bug. The package installs under `/boot/grub/themes/` so the theme stays readable by GRUB even on a LUKS-encrypted root.
- **Theme is delivered entirely by the package** — no theme files are committed into the ISO profile. The live ISO boot menu is intentionally left unchanged (text console): at GRUB time the squashfs isn't mounted, so a package inside the root image can't theme the live menu, and hand-copying theme files into `archiso/grub/` is exactly the duplication we avoid.
- **Bootloader reality:** Kiro installs systemd-boot on UEFI and GRUB only on BIOS, so the theme applies to **BIOS installs**; on UEFI installs `kiro_final` removes `kiro-grub-theme` along with GRUB.
- **Verification:** the installed-system theme render is **confirmed** in a VirtualBox boot (background, Kiro logo/wordmark, `kiro.png` on the kiro entry, blue select bar, restart/shutdown icons all correct).

### Kiro-branded BIOS live-boot splash (syslinux)
- Replaced the stock grey `archiso/syslinux/splash.png` (640×480) with a dark
  Kiro splash — the Kiro logo (logo only, no wordmark) in the top band, above
  where the vesamenu box renders (`MENU VSHIFT 10`), on the same dark gradient as
  the installed GRUB theme. This brands the **BIOS** live USB menu.
- `archiso/syslinux/archiso_head.cfg` — menu `title` colour set to Kiro blue and
  the selected-entry bar to a translucent blue (`#802b8fff`), replacing the grey
  defaults.
- **Scope:** this is the live USB's *own* boot asset, not the `kiro-grub-theme`
  package — a package inside the squashfs can't theme the bootloader (root image
  isn't mounted yet at boot). The UEFI live menu (`grub.cfg`) is intentionally
  left as text console.

### Clarified the NVIDIA driver consequence in the boot menu
- The default boot entry (`driver=free`, previously labeled just "open source: AMD / Intel") makes Calamares' `kiro_remove_nvidia` strip the bundled NVIDIA driver during install — so an NVIDIA user who boots the default silently lands on nouveau with no warning. The boot-menu labels and help text now spell out each path's consequence so the choice is informed.
- All three boot loaders were updated in lockstep (they present the same entries): the systemd-boot UEFI entries (`efiboot/loader/entries/01/02/02b`), the BIOS syslinux menu (`syslinux/archiso_sys-linux.cfg`, which also carries the longer TEXT HELP), and `grub/grub.cfg`.
- New wording:
  - `driver=free` → **"open drivers: AMD / Intel - NVIDIA driver removed"** (help: open stack; the bundled proprietary NVIDIA driver is removed during install; NVIDIA users should pick a 'NVIDIA proprietary' entry instead).
  - `driver=nonfree` → **"NVIDIA proprietary, modern - keeps nvidia"** (keeps whichever NVIDIA driver was baked into the ISO — `nvidia-open-dkms` by default, or a different variant if chosen via the KIB GUI; offline). Worded generically on purpose: KIB can bake `580xx`/`390xx`, so a hardcoded "nvidia-open" would be wrong on those builds.
  - `driver=nonfreechwd` → **"NVIDIA proprietary, auto-detect - needs internet"** (chwd detects and installs the matching driver online, including legacy 470xx/390xx).
- **Text-only** — labels and help strings. No boot parameters, kernel cmdline, or build logic changed. Applied to both this production repo and beta `kiro-iso-next` for parity.
- This is **Part 1** of the NVIDIA driver cleanup. **Part 2** (retiring the redundant `inject_nvidia_packages` build-time selector) is deferred pending chwd field-validation for legacy cards.

### Files Modified
- `archiso/syslinux/archiso_sys-linux.cfg` — MENU LABEL + TEXT HELP for the free / nonfree / nonfreechwd entries.
- `archiso/grub/grub.cfg` — menuentry titles for the three driver entries.
- `archiso/efiboot/loader/entries/01-archiso-linux.conf`, `02-nvidianouveau.conf`, `02b-nvidiachwd.conf` — `title` lines.

## 2026.06.18

### Moved `ananicy-cpp`, `firewalld`, `tuned`, `tuned-ppd` from TIER 2 → TIER 3
- These four sat in **TIER 2 (KIRO CORE)** not because they're untouchable, but because `kiro-calamares-config`'s `services-systemd.conf` enabled their services with `mandatory: true`. With that flag, a user who dropped the package from the ISO would hit Calamares trying to enable a service for a package that isn't installed, and the **whole install would abort**. That made them unsafe to remove, which is the definition of TIER 2.
- The companion change in `kiro-calamares-config` (commit `abbae32`) flipped those services to `mandatory: false`, so a missing package now logs a warning and the install continues. That removes the only blocker, so the four are now genuinely **user-changeable** and belong in TIER 3. They go into a new `### SYSTEM TUNING / SERVICES` group in TIER 3 (so they surface as a droppable category in the ISO Builder / ATT Streamline package screens).
- The two companion apps moved with their parents so nobody is left with an orphaned helper after dropping a service: `cachyos-ananicy-rules-git` (the ruleset `ananicy-cpp` reads) and `firewall-config` (the `firewalld` GTK GUI). `scx-manager` (the `sched_ext` scheduler manager) was moved across too — it has no Calamares service entry, so it was already safe to drop.

### `sardi-icons` → TIER 3, disabled by default
- `sardi-icons` (57.9 MB installed) moved out of the TIER 2 `ICONS / CURSORS / THEMES — default Kiro look` group into a new TIER 3 `ICONS / CURSORS / THEMES` group, and **commented out** so it no longer ships by default. It stays in the file as a documented opt-in (uncomment to re-enable), per the TIER-3 convention that `#`-prefixed lines are deliberately-disabled options kept for reference. Trims the default ISO without losing the option.

### Files Modified
- `archiso/packages.x86_64` — `ananicy-cpp`, `cachyos-ananicy-rules-git`, `firewalld`, `firewall-config`, `scx-manager`, `tuned`, `tuned-ppd` moved from the TIER 2 `SYSTEM TUNING / SERVICES` group into a new TIER 3 group; `sardi-icons` moved to a new TIER 3 `ICONS / CURSORS / THEMES` group and commented out (off by default).

## 2026.06.17

### Fix: `clean_cache()` aborted the build with exit 141 (SIGPIPE) under `pipefail`
- Reported in [issue #15](https://github.com/kirodubes/kiro-iso/issues/15) by rcraig57. With `clean_pacman_cache=yes`, `clean_cache()` ran `yes | sudo pacman -Scc`. `yes` streams `y\n` forever; `pacman -Scc` answers its two confirmation prompts and exits 0, closing the pipe's read end. `yes` is still writing, so the kernel kills it with SIGPIPE (exit 141). Because the script runs under `set -euo pipefail`, the pipeline's status becomes `yes`'s 141 instead of pacman's 0, and `set -e` aborts the whole build — right before Phase 11 (`mkarchiso`), so no ISO was produced. Deterministic, not a race: any host where `yes` outruns pacman's exit (i.e. every normal one) hits it.
- Fix: replaced `yes |` with `printf 'y\ny\n' |`, which feeds exactly the two confirmations `-Scc` needs and then closes cleanly, leaving nothing writing to a closed pipe. The cache-clean step now completes and the build proceeds into `mkarchiso` normally.

### Files Modified
- `build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh` — `clean_cache()` now uses `printf 'y\ny\n' | sudo pacman -Scc` instead of `yes | sudo pacman -Scc`.

## 2026.06.14

### New `AI TOOLS` group in TIER 3 — opt-out AI on the ISO
- AI shouldn't be forced on users. Created a dedicated **`### AI TOOLS`** group in TIER 3 (USER-CHANGEABLE / OPTIONAL) of `packages.x86_64` holding `claude-code` and the new `kiro-assistant` (Claude Code knowledge pack for Kiro). Moved `claude-code` out of the misc `DESKTOP / MISC EXTRAS` bucket into it.
- Because TIER 3 groups surface as categories in the Kiro ISO Builder package screen and ATT Streamline, this gives users a single **AI TOOLS** category they can untick/drop as a whole — "don't want AI? remove it in one move." Keeping both AI packages together also avoids the broken half-state where `kiro-assistant` (which `depends=claude-code`) is kept while `claude-code` is dropped.
- **Build-ordering caveat:** `kiro-assistant` must exist in `nemesis_repo` before an ISO build that includes this line, or `mkarchiso` will fail to resolve it. Publishing `kiro-assistant` to `nemesis_repo` is still pending (GitHub repo not yet created).

### Files Modified
- `archiso/packages.x86_64` — new `AI TOOLS` TIER 3 group (`claude-code` + `kiro-assistant`); `claude-code` removed from `DESKTOP / MISC EXTRAS`.

### Pre-seed `sdl2-compat` to avoid the first-update replace prompt
- A freshly installed ISO showed `:: Replace sdl2 with extra/sdl2-compat? [Y/n]` on the user's first `pacman -Syu`. `sdl2` isn't an explicit package — it's pulled in transitively (ffmpeg, sdl2_image, wxwidgets, qemu-ui-sdl…), so the build installs the old `sdl2` and Arch's `extra/sdl2-compat` (which `Replaces: sdl2`) proposes the swap on first update.
- Fix: add **`sdl2-compat`** explicitly to `packages.x86_64` (new *REPLACEMENT PRE-SEEDS* group). Because it `Provides: sdl2`, the build installs it instead of `sdl2`, satisfies every transitive dep, ships no `sdl2`, and the first `-Syu` has nothing to replace. Zero-risk — `sdl2-compat` is the current Arch default already running on every up-to-date box. Proven first in `kiro-iso-next`, mirrored here for parity. Note this only removes *this* prompt; a rolling ISO can still surface future Arch renames between build and first update — pre-seeding known ones is the mitigation.

### Files Modified
- `archiso/packages.x86_64` — `sdl2-compat` added in a new *REPLACEMENT PRE-SEEDS* group.

## 2026.06.13

### Package-signature enforcement promoted to production
- Ported the signing config proven in `kiro-iso-next` to production: a fresh prod install now **verifies signed `nemesis_repo`/`kiro_repo` packages out of the box**. Closes the gap where prod pulled GitHub-Pages binaries with no cryptographic proof of origin. (Signing itself has been live on both repos since the rollout began; this turns on *enforcement* — it signs nothing new.)

### Technical Details
- All four pacman.confs (`archiso/airootfs/etc/pacman.conf`, `…/pacman.conf.kiro`, `archiso/pacman.conf`, `build-scripts/pacman.conf`) — dropped the per-repo `SigLevel` lines from `nemesis_repo`/`kiro_repo`/`chaotic-aur` so they inherit the global `[options] SigLevel = Required DatabaseOptional` (single source of truth).
- `build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh` — `prepopulate_keyring()` now `--populate kiro` into the airootfs keyring; `main()` calls `setup_kiro_keyring`.
- `build-scripts/host-prep.sh` — new `setup_kiro_keyring` guard (installed? skip; else `pacman -S --needed kiro-keyring`) so `--populate kiro` has `kiro.gpg` on a clean build host.
- **Safe rollout:** no package ships `/etc/pacman.conf`, so the existing fleet's local config is never overwritten — this only affects *new* installs, which get the key (prepopulated) and enforcement together. The key also reaches the fleet via the `kiro-system-files → kiro-keyring` dependency. Paired with `kiro-calamares-config`'s `kiro_before --populate kiro` (same release).

### Files Modified
- `archiso/airootfs/etc/pacman.conf`, `archiso/airootfs/etc/pacman.conf.kiro`, `archiso/pacman.conf`, `build-scripts/pacman.conf`, `build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh`, `build-scripts/host-prep.sh`

## 2026-06-13 — Re-tiered packages.x86_64 so KIB can opt out of onboard, Bluetooth, printing and CJK/MS fonts

The Kiro ISO Builder's **Packages** screen only ever lists **TIER 3** of **`archiso/packages.x86_64`** (`read_tier3()` in `kiro-iso-builder/functions.py`); TIER 1 (frozen) and TIER 2 (core) are deliberately never shown so the page can't offer a build-breaking package. The side effect was that several genuinely-optional packages sat in TIER 1/2 where a user could **never** untick them in KIB — most visibly **`onboard`**, which had been parked in the TIER 1 *Installer / Calamares* block even though nothing in the build/boot/install path depends on it (the SDDM greeter's on-screen keyboard is the separate `qt5-virtualkeyboard`).

Moved four clusters down into TIER 3, each as its own labelled category so they appear as distinct, self-documenting opt-out groups in KIB:

- **Accessibility** — `onboard` (its own category, leaving room for the planned ISO-side a11y work)
- **Bluetooth** — `blueberry`, `bluez`, `bluez-libs`, `bluez-utils`
- **Printing & scanning** — `cups`, `cups-filters`, `cups-pdf`, `ghostscript`, `gsfonts`, `gutenprint`, `simple-scan`, `system-config-printer`
- **Fonts — optional** — the three `adobe-source-han-sans-*` CJK families, `ttf-ms-fonts`, plus five Latin fonts no shipped Kiro config references (`adobe-source-sans-fonts`, `ttf-droid`, `ttf-roboto`, `ttf-roboto-mono`, `ttf-ubuntu-font-family`). The four load-bearing fonts stay in TIER 2: `noto-fonts` ("Noto Sans" — the default GTK/xfwm4/polybar/dmenu UI font), `ttf-hack` (alacritty + xfce4-terminal), `ttf-font-awesome` (polybar icons), and `ttf-dejavu` (toolkit glyph fallback); `noto-fonts-emoji` is also kept (emoji glyphs).

This is **byte-identical for a default build** — TIER 3 ships fully by default (everything ticked = stock ISO), so the only change is that KIB now exposes four new opt-out categories. The groups were moved **whole** on purpose: KIB excludes a package by commenting its line out, which only truly drops it if nothing still-shipping pulls it back as a dependency, so a closed group (all four Bluetooth lines, the full CUPS set) is the unit a user can actually remove. The fonts are fully clean — the browsers' `ttf-font` requirement is **virtual**, satisfied by the retained `noto-fonts`/`ttf-dejavu`, so none of the optional fonts get pulled back. Two cross-tier pins remain by design and are harmless: **`bluez-libs`** is hard-required by the shipped `pipewire-audio`, and **`gsfonts`** by the shipped `evince` — so those two tiny packages survive deselection even though the rest of their group is removed. Verified the new categories parse via KIB's own `read_tier3()` and confirmed the dependency facts against the synced pacman databases.

- **`archiso/packages.x86_64`** — removed the Bluetooth, Printing/Scanning and CJK/MS-font lines from TIER 2 (and the stale "safe to drop" note); moved `onboard` out of the TIER 1 installer block; added `ACCESSIBILITY`, `BLUETOOTH`, `PRINTING & SCANNING` and `FONTS — OPTIONAL` categories under TIER 3.

## 2026-06-12 — On-screen keyboard (onboard) ships, with five Kiro themes

Added **`onboard`** to **`archiso/packages.x86_64`** so the on-screen keyboard is present out of the box — for touchscreen, tablet and mobility-impaired users. It is an **on-demand** tool (application menu / the Arch Linux Tweak Tool's Accessibility page), launched only when needed, so it stays invisible to users who don't want it and there is no autostart. `onboard` lives in Arch **`extra`** (1.4.1-14), so the build pulls it with no extra repo and no AUR. onboard is the **in-session** keyboard; the SDDM login greeter is a separate concern (tracked as a future Qt VirtualKeyboard task — SDDM has no onboard hook).

Paired with this, the companion **`kiro-system-files`** package ships **five custom Kiro onboard themes** — **Kiro Aurora** (signature dark blue→green), **Kiro Daylight** (light, for bright rooms / low-vision light preference), **Kiro Beacon** (high-contrast amber-on-black accessibility flagship), **Kiro Emerald**, **Kiro Azure** — installed to `/usr/share/onboard/themes/`, with **Kiro Azure** set as the default via a gsettings schema override (a default, not a lock; users keep any theme they pick). Those files are documented in that package's own changelog, not here.

- **`archiso/packages.x86_64`** — added **`onboard`**.

## 2026-06-11 — Kernel discovery lists the full repo offering; enable_cachyos host-prep (mirrored from beta)

Promoted from `kiro-iso-next` after validation. **`build-scripts/list-kernels.sh`** no longer curates the kernel list — it now reports **every** kernel the enabled repos carry, where "a kernel" is still any package `X` with a matching `X-headers` (the discriminator that separates a real kernel from a companion package like `*-zfs`/`*-nvidia` and guarantees the DKMS drivers can build). The old version probed a fixed candidate list plus a few hard-coded families and **deliberately excluded** CPU-microarch builds; that exclusion is gone, and the implementation is simpler/faster (one `pacman -Sl` pass building a name→repo map instead of a `pacman -Si` per candidate). The **default stdout is unchanged in shape** — kernel names, one per line (now sorted) — so the build's `detect_available_kernels()` → `mapfile` consumer is unaffected, and fixed kernels are still validated directly with `pacman -Si`. A new **`--with-repo`** flag emits `"<repo><TAB><kernel>"` for the GUI to group by source; the build never passes it. Note: the interactive `kernel="ask"` picker (and bad-name suggestions) now also offer microarch kernels — intended, and buildability is unaffected since they still have headers.

Relatedly, **`build-scripts/host-prep.sh`** gained **`enable_cachyos()`** — Kiro ships `[cachyos]` commented out (chaotic-aur is the backstop), but a handful of CachyOS flavors (`linux-cachyos-eevdf`, `-hardened`, `-bmq`, `-cacule`, `-deckify`, `-server`, `-rt-bore`) live only in the `cachyos` repo. When the keyring/mirrorlist are present but the repo is commented out, `enable_cachyos()` uncomments just the `[cachyos]` block (awk-scoped to the header + its commented config lines, stopping at the next blank line/section, with a `/etc/pacman.conf.kiro-bak` backup) and re-syncs — distinct from `setup_cachyos()` (from-scratch install). The kiro-iso-builder GUI invokes it through the existing **`host-prep-run.sh`** dispatcher, only when a selected kernel needs it.

- **`build-scripts/list-kernels.sh`** — generic everything-with-`-headers` discovery; `--with-repo` option; header comment rewritten.
- **`build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh`** — corrected the stale "only real kernels, no false positives" comment above `detect_available_kernels()`.
- **`build-scripts/host-prep.sh`** / **`host-prep-run.sh`** — new `enable_cachyos()` + Usage comment.

## 2026-06-11 — Budgie live ISO autologins instead of stopping at the SDDM greeter

A Budgie ISO built with KIB booted to the **SDDM login screen** instead of autologging into the desktop. Root cause was a **session-name mismatch**, not a missing autologin path. `apply_editions()` in **`build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh`** writes the live ISO's SDDM autologin session by `sed`-ing `default_session` straight into `Session=` in **`/etc/sddm.conf.d/kde_settings.conf`** — and KIB stores the **edition name** (`budgie`) there. For every other edition the edition name happens to equal the session `.desktop` basename (xfce→`xfce`, gnome→`gnome`, plasma→`plasma`, cinnamon→`cinnamon`), so they autologin fine. **Budgie is the lone exception**: Arch's **`budgie-desktop`** package ships its session as **`wayland-sessions/budgie-desktop.desktop`**, so SDDM needs `Session=budgie-desktop`. `Session=budgie` matched nothing, autologin silently failed, and the greeter appeared.

The fix is a small **edition→session-basename map** placed right before the `Session=` `sed`: `budgie` resolves to `budgie-desktop`, every other edition passes through unchanged. This keeps KIB dumb (it still writes plain edition names) and puts the one piece of Budgie-specific knowledge at the canonical write point, rather than renaming/symlinking the session file in airootfs where a package update could clobber it.

- **`build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh`** — `apply_editions()` now maps the SDDM autologin session basename (`budgie` → `budgie-desktop`) before writing `Session=`.



Promoted from `kiro-iso-next` after validation on the beta ISO (Budgie launches; **XFCE and ohmychadwm regression-tested and unaffected**).

On a **Budgie** live ISO the installer would not start. Budgie's session is Wayland with **labwc** as the compositor, and **Calamares is a Qt xcb/X11 app** launched as **root** via `pkexec` from **`calamares_polkit`**. Under labwc the root process has no authorization for the user's XWayland display, so Calamares died with `Authorization required, but no authorization protocol specified` / `qt.qpa.xcb: could not connect to display :1`. (Two early suspects were ruled out: `xcb-util-cursor` is already present — the `xcb-cursor0 ... is needed` line is Qt's generic message whenever the xcb plugin fails — and the SDDM autologin `Session=` naming is a separate concern.)

This is **not "all Wayland"**: **GNOME-Wayland (mutter)** and **Plasma-Wayland (kwin)** launch the installer fine — those compositors set up XWayland so root can connect; minimal compositors like **labwc** do not. So the fix in **`calamares_polkit`** (shipped by the **`calamares`** package) keys on the **observable symptom, not the compositor**: it probes whether a root process can already reach the X display (`sudo -n env DISPLAY=… XAUTHORITY=… xhost`) and only when it can't does it grant access (`xhost +SI:localuser:root`, with a `trap` revoke and `DISPLAY`/`XAUTHORITY` passed through `pkexec`). Where root already reaches the display the launcher takes the **byte-for-byte original path**, and because the grant is additive + revoked, even a false-positive probe cannot regress a working session. Future Wayland editions (Hyprland, niri) are handled with no further code change.

- **`calamares_polkit`** (in the `calamares` package) — runtime probe + conditional `xhost` grant; original path untouched where root already reaches the display.
- **`archiso/packages.x86_64`** — added **`xorg-xhost`** (provides the `xhost` the launcher needs; tiny, harmless on X11).

## 2026-06-10 — GTK-stack desktops (GNOME, Budgie) get the same theme-override fix as Plasma

`apply_plasma_rules()` in **`build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh`** now fires for the **GTK-stack desktops** (**GNOME** and **Budgie**) as well as Plasma. Booting a GNOME edition built from the ISO hit the same breakage Plasma did: the XFCE-oriented overrides Kiro ships in **`/etc/environment`** (`QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME`, `QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE`, `GTK_THEME=Arc-Dawn-Dark`) stomp the desktop's own theme management and trigger the yellow "could not apply theme" popup. Budgie is GTK/GNOME-stack and shares the same failure, so it's covered in the same pass — before its first build.

The fix is deliberately asymmetric so each desktop gets only what it needs:

- **`/etc/environment` commenting** (all three vars) now runs for **`plasma` or a GTK-stack desktop (`gnome`, `budgie`)** in `editions=`. This is the actual GNOME/Budgie fix — those overrides fight any desktop that manages its own theming.
- **The `qt5ct`/`qt6ct` package strip stays Plasma-only.** It exists to resolve a real `plasma-integration` conflict; on the GTK-stack desktops `qt5ct` is merely unused, and removing it would leave Qt apps with no theming integration, so **GNOME and Budgie keep `qt5ct` installed**.
- The **gnome + plasma** portal warning (the `gnome` group pulls `xdg-desktop-portal-gnome`, which conflicts with `xdg-desktop-portal-kde`) still fires only when *both* are selected.

A new `has_gtk_de` flag (gnome or budgie) drives branch 2, keeping the gate easy to extend to cinnamon/mate later. The function name is kept as `apply_plasma_rules` to avoid churning the call site and the HQ build tutorial; the header comment and the runtime `log_section` label ("Qt/GTK theme rules") are updated to reflect the broader scope. ISOs that select none of these (the default `xfce ohmychadwm`) are completely untouched — verified on temp copies across all cases (default no-op, gnome, budgie, plasma, budgie+plasma, gnome+plasma, and a re-run for idempotency). The `sed` edits remain whole-line/idempotent.

## 2026-06-09 — Promote editions + add-apps system from kiro-iso-next

**What Changed**
- **Desktop/WM editions system** — `build-the-iso.sh` gained `apply_editions()`, which uncomments the `### >>> EDITION-BLOCK <name> >>>` block in **`archiso/packages.x86_64`** for each name in `build.conf`'s new `editions=` knob. Seven edition blocks ship (awesome, bspwm, chadwm, i3, ohmychadwm, leftwm, qtile), all commented by default. New `default_session=` knob sets the live-ISO SDDM autologin session.
- **EXTRA-APP "add apps" overlay** — `build-the-iso.sh` gained `apply_package_additions()`, which uncomments `### >>> EXTRA-APP <key> >>>` blocks for each key listed in the new **`build-scripts/package-additions.conf`** (shipped empty = standard ISO). This is the overlay the `kiro-iso-builder` GUI's "Add apps" page reads/writes.
- **`build-scripts/build.conf.defaults`** — added the `editions="xfce ohmychadwm"` and `default_session="xfce"` defaults.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — documented the new editions/add-apps stages; **`docs/OVERVIEW.md`** refreshed.

**Why**
- These features matured in the `kiro-iso-next` beta profile and are ready for production. The default `editions="xfce ohmychadwm"` reproduces the current standard ISO byte-for-byte in behaviour, so the *default* build output is unchanged — the extra WMs and apps are strictly opt-in.

**Technical Details**
- **Selective promotion, not a blanket sync.** Production identity was preserved on the way in:
  - `archiso/packages.x86_64` — adopted next's edition/extra-app blocks but reverted the 6 beta package names back to production: `calamares-next`→`calamares`, `kiro-bootloader-grub-nemesis`→`kiro-bootloader-grub`, `kiro-calamares-config-next`→`kiro-calamares-config`, `kiro-calamares-tweak-tool-nemesis`→`kiro-calamares-tweak-tool`, `plymouth-theme-kiro-logo-nemesis`→`plymouth-theme-kiro-logo`, `kiro-iso-builder-nemesis`→`kiro-iso-builder`.
  - `build-the-iso.sh` — kept production's `kiro-` ISO label naming (next used `kiro-next-`) and its integrated `apply_version_bump()` Phase 2.
  - Not migrated: `build.conf` (gitignored local state), the build-generated version fields in `dev-rel`/`profiledef.sh`, and `profiledef.sh`'s `iso_name="kiro"`.

**Files Modified**
- `archiso/packages.x86_64`, `build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh`, `build-scripts/build.conf.defaults`, `build-scripts/package-additions.conf` (new), `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/OVERVIEW.md`

## 2026-06-08 — Make Flameshot an optional (TIER 3) package

**What Changed**
- In **`archiso/packages.x86_64`**, moved **`flameshot-git`** out of the `### OHMYCHADWM RUNTIME` group (TIER 2) into the `### MEDIA / GRAPHICS` group (TIER 3), so the **kiro-iso-builder** "Choose packages" screen now lets a user remove it.

**Why**
- Flameshot is a screenshot tool that overlaps with **`maim`** and **`scrot`**, both of which stay in the runtime — so the session does not depend on it and it is genuinely optional. The TIER 3 gate was checked first: it has no build/boot/Calamares dependency, no enabled systemd unit, and **no shipped package depends on it** (verified with `expac`), so un-ticking it in the builder really removes it. One known cost, accepted on purpose: Flameshot **is** referenced by the Ohmychadwm session — the `run flameshot` autostart line in **`run.sh`** and the `ctrl + super + Print → flameshot gui` binding in **`sxhkd/sxhkdrc`** (plus the `keybindings.*` cheatsheets and the XFCE `keybindings.html`). None of those are guarded, so a user who removes Flameshot is left with a dead screenshot shortcut and a stale cheatsheet entry. That only affects users who deliberately remove it (it still ships by default); guarding the binding/cheatsheet is a separate follow-up in the `ohmychadwm` / `kiro-xfce` repos.

**Files Modified**
- `archiso/packages.x86_64` — `flameshot-git` moved from `OHMYCHADWM RUNTIME` (TIER 2) to `MEDIA / GRAPHICS` (TIER 3).

## 2026-06-08 — Fix `exit 141` (SIGPIPE) crash in the mirror health check

**What Changed**
- In **`build-scripts/host-prep.sh`** `mirror_health_report()`, replaced the two `grep -oP … | head -1` mirrorlist reads with `grep -m1 -oP …` (lines 210 and 218).

**Why**
- Under `set -euo pipefail`, `grep … | head -1` is a SIGPIPE trap: `head` closes the pipe after the first line, and if `grep` is still writing (a normal multi-server `reflector` mirrorlist easily exceeds the 64 KB pipe buffer) it gets **SIGPIPE**, the pipeline exits **141**, and `errexit` aborts the whole build — right after the "Mirror health check — all repos must be green before building" banner, before a single repo status prints. Whether it fires is **grep-implementation- and buffer-timing-dependent**, so it failed for some users (stock GNU grep) while building fine for others — the classic "works on my machine" report. Surfaced by **cyberagency on Discussions #39**: every build died in ~6 s with `FAILED (exit 141)`, leaving the build folder behind so the next attempt re-prompted to delete it (the apparent "loop"). `grep -m1` makes grep stop after the first match itself — no pipe, no reader to close early, SIGPIPE impossible on any grep flavor. Verified: `yes | head -1` under `pipefail` reproduces exit 141 on the dev box; the `-m1` form cannot.

**Files Modified**
- `build-scripts/host-prep.sh` — `grep -m1` in `mirror_health_report()` (Arch + Chaotic mirrorlist reads).

## 2026-06-08 — v26.06.08 — Ship GRUB boot-safety hooks + spice-vdagent (promoted from -next)

**What Changed**
- Added **`kiro-bootloader-grub`** (INSTALLER/CALAMARES section) and **`spice-vdagent`** (LIVE-ENV GUEST TOOLS section) to **`archiso/packages.x86_64`**.

**Why**
- **`kiro-bootloader-grub`** ships two pacman hooks that re-run `grub-install`/`grub-mkconfig` so a `grub` upgrade can't brick boot (the classic Arch `grub_*` symbol mismatch). BIOS disk is auto-detected (`grub-probe`+`lsblk`, never hardcoded `/dev/sda`); proven on `sda` (VirtualBox + worf metal) and `vda` (QEMU). `kiro_final` keeps it on grub installs and strips it (with `grub`) on systemd-boot.
- **`spice-vdagent`** gives QEMU/SPICE guests host↔guest clipboard; `kiro_final` keeps it on kvm/qemu and strips it elsewhere. (Not a resolution fix — auto-resize is broken on XFCE; that's a Display-settings matter.)
- Both validated in `kiro-iso-next` before this promotion.

**Files Modified**
- `archiso/packages.x86_64` — `kiro-bootloader-grub` + `spice-vdagent`.

**What Changed**
- The live `build-scripts/build.conf` is now **gitignored**; a tracked canonical **`build.conf.defaults`** holds the shipped values.
- `build-the-iso.sh` seeds `build.conf` from `build.conf.defaults` on first use (replacing the old "FATAL: not found" exit).
- `unmount-build.sh`'s pre-source `build_location` default changed `local` → `home` to match the canonical default when `build.conf` is briefly absent.

**Why**
- `build.conf` is both the *shipped default* and the *live working config* the CLI/GUI write during a build. That dual role meant a local test tweak (e.g. `kernel="linux-lts"`) got swept into `up.sh`'s `git add --all` and pushed to the public BYOI repo. Splitting the two — gitignored working copy seeded from a tracked default — makes that class of leak impossible by construction, no scrubbing logic needed. `up.sh` is untouched (its `git add --all` simply skips the ignored file).

**Technical Details**
- `build.conf` removed from tracking with `git rm --cached` (working copy kept). Cloners get `build.conf.defaults`; the CLI seeds on first build, the `kiro-iso-builder` GUI seeds at startup / after a clone.

**Files Modified**
- `.gitignore`, `build-scripts/build.conf.defaults` (new), `build-scripts/build.conf` (untracked), `build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh`, `build-scripts/unmount-build.sh`

## 2026-06-07 — Fail-safe: unmount on interrupt, not just before the next build

**What Changed**
- `build-the-iso.sh` now unmounts on **any** early exit, not just before the next build. An **`EXIT`** trap (`unmount_stale_build_mounts`) is the real net — it fires on a signal-driven exit, a `set -e` build failure, or a normal end, and is a no-op after a clean build (mkarchiso already unmounted, so `findmnt` finds nothing). **`INT`/`TERM`** traps sit on top to add the log line + correct exit code (130/143), so a `Ctrl-C`/`kill` (CLI) or the GUI Stop button's `SIGTERM` cleans up immediately.
- New standalone **`build-scripts/unmount-build.sh`** with two modes: `check` (read-only, lists stale mounts under the work dir, exit 1 if any — no root) and `clean` (unmounts them, run as root). It derives the work dir exactly like `build-the-iso.sh` (sources `build.conf`, `build_location` local/home, `PKEXEC_UID`-aware home resolution).

**Why**
- The existing `unmount_stale_build_mounts()` only ran at the **start of the next build**. An interrupted build therefore left mkarchiso's bind-mounts live in the meantime — enough to jam the file manager and, in one case, **freeze the host into a hard reboot**. Cleaning up *at interrupt time* closes that window. `unmount-build.sh` gives the `kiro-iso-builder` GUI (its Stop handler + a new pre-flight check) one shared, dependency-free way to detect and clear the same mounts.

**Technical Details**
- `unmount-build.sh` reuses the proven `findmnt`→`awk` literal-prefix filter (deepest-first) and `umount -R -l` loop. `check` mode stays exit-code-clean so the GUI can gate its polkit prompt on it. Off-template lean launcher (sibling of `host-prep-run.sh`); listed in `Kiro-HQ/TEMPLATE_EXCLUSIONS.md`.

**Files Modified**
- `build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh`, `build-scripts/unmount-build.sh` (new)

---

## 2026-06-07 — Safety: unmount stale build mounts before `rm -rf` (prevents wiping host `/dev`)

**What Changed**
- Added **`unmount_stale_build_mounts()`** in `build-the-iso.sh`, called from `remove_buildfolder()` right before `sudo rm -rf "${buildFolder}"`. It lazily unmounts (deepest-first) anything still mounted under the build folder.

**Why**
- mkarchiso bind-mounts the host `/dev`, `/proc`, `/sys`, `/run`, etc. into the work-dir chroot. If a build is **interrupted** (e.g. the GUI is quit mid-build), those bind-mounts are left behind. The next build's `rm -rf "${buildFolder}"` would then **recurse into the bind-mounted `/dev` and delete the real host device nodes** (notably `/dev/null`), breaking the system's shell until reboot — and at minimum it blocked the rebuild with "device busy". Unmounting first makes every build self-heal from a prior interrupted run and removes the foot-gun entirely.

**Technical Details**
- Targets are found with `findmnt -rno TARGET` filtered to paths under `${buildFolder}` via `awk` (literal prefix match — no regex-metachar issues), sorted reverse so children unmount before parents. Uses `umount -R -l` (recursive, lazy) with a plain `umount -l` fallback; failures are tolerated.

**Files Modified**
- `build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh`

## 2026-06-07 — TIER 3 package selection: `apply_package_selection()` + overlay file

**What Changed**
- Added **`build-scripts/package-selection.conf`** (an exclude list, empty by default) and a new **`apply_package_selection()`** in `build-the-iso.sh` that comments out the listed TIER 3 packages in the build-tree copy of `packages.x86_64`, right after it is copied in.

**Why**
- Backs the new **Packages** screen in the `kiro-iso-builder` GUI: the user unticks optional apps, the GUI writes them here, and the build leaves them out — without ever editing the tracked `archiso/packages.x86_64` (it stays pristine, same overlay pattern as `build.conf`). Only TIER 3 (USER-CHANGEABLE) packages are eligible; TIER 1/2 are out of scope, so a selection can never break the build.

**Technical Details**
- The exclusion is a literal whole-line `awk` match (no regex-metachar pitfalls) that only ever prepends `#`, so it can drop an optional package but never add one, and can't touch kernel/nvidia lines (handled separately later). A missing or empty file ships the full TIER 3 set — fully backward compatible.

**Files Modified**
- `build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh`, `build-scripts/package-selection.conf` (new)

## 2026-06-07 — Extract kernel discovery into `list-kernels.sh`

**What Changed**
- Moved the kernel-detection logic out of `build-the-iso.sh`'s `detect_available_kernels()` into a new standalone script, **`build-scripts/list-kernels.sh`**, which prints the offerable kernels (one per line) to stdout. `detect_available_kernels()` now just `mapfile`s that output.

**Why**
- Single source of truth shared with the `kiro-iso-builder` GUI: its **Detect available kernels** button runs the exact same script, so the CLI and GUI can never disagree on which kernels are offerable. The filter is unchanged — a kernel qualifies only if both `<k>` and `<k>-headers` exist (the `-headers` test rejects companion packages like `zfs`/`nvidia` and guarantees the DKMS drivers can build), and CPU-microarch/niche kernels stay excluded.

**Technical Details**
- `list-kernels.sh` is intentionally off-template: stdout must stay machine-readable (kernel names only, no log/colour banners). Read-only — `pacman -Si`/`-Slq` against the synced DBs, never root.

**Files Modified**
- `build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh`, `build-scripts/list-kernels.sh` (new)

## 2026-06-07 — Extract build knobs into `build.conf`; add `host-prep-run.sh` dispatcher

**What Changed**
- Moved the user-editable configuration block out of **`build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh`** and into a new sourced file, **`build-scripts/build.conf`** (`desktop`, `bump_version`, `nvidia_driver`, `kernel`, `picker`, `chaoticsrepo`, `clean_pacman_cache`, `parallel_downloads`, `remove_build_folder`, `build_location`). `build-the-iso.sh` now `source`s it right after defining `kiroVersion`.
- Added **`build-scripts/host-prep-run.sh`** — a thin dispatcher that supplies lightweight `log_*` shims, sources `build.conf` and `host-prep.sh`, then runs one named host-prep function (e.g. `host-prep-run.sh setup_cachyos`).

**Why**
- These changes back the new **`kiro-iso-builder`** GTK4 GUI. `build.conf` is the single source of truth both the CLI and the GUI read and write, so the GUI never has to sed-edit a live script. The dispatcher lets the GUI run a single idempotent fix (`ensure_package` / `setup_chaotic` / `setup_cachyos`) in isolation under `pkexec` — `host-prep.sh` itself requires a caller that provides the `log_*` helpers, which this wrapper does.

**Technical Details**
- `kiroVersion` deliberately **stays** in `build-the-iso.sh`: `apply_version_bump` (Phase 2) seds it and `verify_version_sync` greps it. `build.conf` never carries the version. The derived paths (`build_location` branch, `isoLabel`, `PACKAGES_FILE`) still sit below the `source` line, unchanged, since `REPO_DIR` is defined far earlier (line 13).
- `host-prep-run.sh` is intentionally off-template (no banner colours / `on_error` trap / `main()`): it is a sourced-fragment launcher whose only job is to provide the minimal environment `host-prep.sh` needs.

**Files Modified**
- `build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh`, `build-scripts/build.conf` (new), `build-scripts/host-prep-run.sh` (new), `CLAUDE.md`

## 2026-06-07 — Add `[cachyos]` to the host `pacman.conf` so the overwrite never drops it

**What Changed**
- Added a **`[cachyos]`** repo block to **`build-scripts/pacman.conf`**, using a direct CDN77 geo-mirror (`Server = https://cdn77.cachyos.org/repo/$arch/$repo`) rather than `Include = /etc/pacman.d/cachyos-mirrorlist`.

**Why**
- `build-scripts/pacman.conf` is the host-side reference that `get-pacman-repos-keys-and-mirrors.sh`'s `configure_pacman_conf()` copies **wholesale** over `/etc/pacman.conf` when setting up Chaotic-AUR. It had no `[cachyos]` block, so on a host that already had the cachyos keyring+mirrorlist installed (e.g. CachyOS, or a previously-built box) but not yet Chaotic, the overwrite **wiped the existing `[cachyos]`** — and `setup_cachyos` then early-returns (keyring already present) and never re-adds it, leaving the build with no cachyos repo for the `linux-cachyos` kernel. Carrying the block in the source file closes that gap; `setup_cachyos`'s `grep -q '^\[cachyos\]'` guard keeps the later append idempotent (it finds this block and skips, so no duplicate).
- The direct **CDN77 server** (not `Include`) is deliberate: this host config can be written *before* `cachyos-mirrorlist` exists, so it must carry its own working server — exactly the block `setup_cachyos` would otherwise append. An `Include` would point at a missing file on a fresh host and make `pacman -Sy cachyos-mirrorlist` fail with no servers configured. The shipped ISO configs (`archiso/pacman.conf`, `archiso/airootfs/etc/pacman.conf`) keep `Include` because they only run after the mirrorlist package is guaranteed present.

## 2026-06-07 — Robust mirror setup: curated geo-CDN mirrorlists + host→curated fallback + an "all green" pre-build gate

**What Changed**
- **Trimmed the shipped Arch mirrorlist** (`archiso/airootfs/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist`) from **605 uncommented worldwide servers down to 4 geo-routed CDN mirrors** — `geo.mirror.pkgbuild.com`, `fastly.mirror.pkgbuild.com`, `mirrors.kernel.org`, `mirror.rackspace.com`. This is the list the live ISO carries and Calamares copies to the installed system.
- **Added a curated Chaotic-AUR mirrorlist** (`archiso/airootfs/etc/pacman.d/chaotic-mirrorlist`, new file) with the two official Chaotic CDNs — `geo-mirror.chaotic.cx` and `cdn-mirror.chaotic.cx`. It overrides the long country list the `chaotic-mirrorlist` package would otherwise drop on the installed system.
- **Added a build-host mirror fallback** in `host-prep.sh`: `ensure_arch_mirrors` and `ensure_chaotic_mirrors` probe the user's own pacman mirrors first and keep them when they work; only when *every* probed host mirror is unreachable do they swap in Kiro's curated geo-CDN set (backing the original up to `*.kiro-bak`).
- **Added an "all green" pre-build gate** — `mirror_health_report` probes one representative server per repo (Arch + Chaotic at both the build/host and shipped-curated layers, plus `nemesis_repo` and `kiro_repo`) and prints an `[ OK ]/[ NOK ]` table. The build aborts before `mkarchiso` if a required repo (Arch or Chaotic) is fully unreachable; the two Kiro single-server CDNs are warn-only.
- **Wired the new steps into `build-the-iso.sh`**: `ensure_arch_mirrors` runs inside preflight *before* `pacman -Sy`; `ensure_chaotic_mirrors` runs right after `setup_chaotic`; `mirror_health_report` runs after the CachyOS setup as the final gate before the build tree is prepared.

**Why**
- A user reported install failures traced to Arch mirror trouble while building on CachyOS. There are two independent Arch-mirror layers: the **build** pulls `[core]/[extra]` through the *host's* `/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist` (mkarchiso resolves the `Include` against the host root), while the **install** uses the mirrorlist *shipped in the airootfs*. The shipped list had 605 active servers — pacman spreads `ParallelDownloads` across them, so installs hit a long tail of dead/slow mirrors and crawl or fail. Geo-routed CDNs are fast and complete everywhere on earth without per-location tuning, which is the right default for a worldwide ISO.
- The fallback encodes the requested policy — *prefer the user's PC mirror settings, fall back to our own curated setup only if those fail* — so a healthy host (e.g. a fresh reflector list) builds against its own fast local mirrors, while a broken/empty host mirrorlist no longer dead-ends the build. `nemesis_repo` and `kiro_repo` are already single GitHub-Pages servers, so they were left as-is and are probed for reporting only.

**Technical Details**
- `_probe_mirror <server-template> <repo> [arch]` substitutes `$repo`/`$arch` into a `Server =` template and HEAD-checks the repo's `.db` with `wget --spider` (8s timeout, single try); a reachable `.db` is the green signal and the fallback trigger.
- `_write_curated_list` backs up the existing file to `*.kiro-bak` (once) before writing the curated mirrors via `sudo tee`, so the user's original is recoverable.
- Curated mirror sets live as `KIRO_CURATED_ARCH_MIRRORS` / `KIRO_CURATED_CHAOTIC_MIRRORS` arrays in `host-prep.sh`, kept in sync with the two shipped airootfs mirrorlists.
- Verified green end-to-end on the CachyOS build host: all six probe lines returned `[ OK ]` (host Arch + chaotic, shipped curated Arch + chaotic, nemesis, kiro).

## 2026-06-07 — Pin `pipewire-jack` as the `jack` provider

**What Changed**
- Added **`pipewire-jack`** to the PipeWire audio block in `archiso/packages.x86_64`.

**Why**
- Something in the package set pulls in a `jack` dependency, and with both `jack2` and `pipewire-jack` available pacman stopped the build with an interactive provider prompt (defaulting to `jack2`). The ISO already ships the full PipeWire stack, so `pipewire-jack` is the correct provider — it serves the JACK API through PipeWire with no separate daemon, and `jack2` would conflict with PipeWire's JACK integration. Pinning it removes the prompt so the build never stalls (and an automated build can't silently pick the wrong default).

**Files Modified**
- `archiso/packages.x86_64`

## 2026-06-07 — Restyle build phases: sequential, gap-free numbering in execution order

**What Changed**
- Renumbered every `log_section "Phase …"` label in **`build-the-iso.sh`** so the phases run **1 → 12 in strict execution order**, with no sub-letters. The old scheme had `Phase 2b`, `2c`, `6b` (confusing — there was never a `2a`) and was also out of order: `main()` ran Phase 2 → 2b → 2c → *then* Phase 1.
- The maintainer-only `.bashrc` skel-refresh step (former `Phase 2c`) is now an **unnumbered** `log_section`, because it only runs on the maintainer host — numbering it would leave a gap (a "missing Phase") in every other user's build output, which is the exact confusion this change removes.
- Extracted the two inline blocks left in `main()` into functions — **"Checking required packages"** → `check_required_packages()` (Phase 4), and the maintainer-only skel `.bashrc` refresh → `refresh_skel_bashrc()` (with its `hq` host guard moved inside as an early return). `main()` is now a uniform top-to-bottom list of phase calls with no inlined logic.
- Updated **`BYOI.md`** ("nine phases" → "twelve numbered phases").

**Why**
- The phase numbers had drifted as steps were inserted over time, leaving sub-lettered labels and a run order that didn't match the numbers. For a user watching the build scroll past, "Phase 2b" with no "2a", and "Phase 1" appearing after "Phase 2", read as bugs. Sequential, gap-free numbering that matches the actual run order makes the build log self-explanatory. CLAUDE.md's "Phase 2 = version bump" references stay valid since the version bump remains Phase 2.

**Technical Details**
- New execution order: 1 Preflight · 2 Bump version · 3 Verify version sync · 4 Check required packages · 5 Prepare build tree · 6 Refresh skel + package list · 7 Prepopulate keyring · 8 Inject NVIDIA · 9 Apply kernel(s) · 10 Stamp build date · 11 mkarchiso · 12 Checksums + pkglist. The unnumbered host-setup helpers (`setup_chaotic`, `ensure_chaotic_mirrors`, `setup_cachyos`, `mirror_health_report`) and the maintainer skel-refresh sit between phases without consuming a number.

## 2026-06-07 — Generalize `record-install-time.sh` for any Arch host / any user

**What Changed**
- Reworked **`record-install-time.sh`** so it no longer hardcodes a single developer's environment. Previously every SSH command was built around a literal `<user>`/`<pw>` password login with personal host shortcuts and a fixed port.
- **Target syntax** is now generic: `vm` resolves to the VirtualBox NAT default (localhost, port `2022`); any other target is parsed as `[user@]host[:port]` (e.g. `<user>@<host>`, `<host>:2222`). The personal host shortcuts were dropped.
- **Authentication** defaults to key/agent auth (plain `ssh`). Password auth is now opt-in through the new `--password` flag or the `KIRO_SSH_PASS` env var, with an early guard that aborts with a clear message if the `sshpass` package isn't installed.
- **New flags** `--user`, `--port`, `--password`; user/port/password resolve highest-precedence-first: the `user@`/`:port` in the target or the flags → the `KIRO_SSH_USER` / `KIRO_SSH_PORT` / `KIRO_SSH_PASS` env vars → built-in defaults (`$USER`, port `22`/`2022`, key auth).
- Rewrote the `--help` text and the file header to document the new target syntax and resolution order.

**Why**
- The goal is to let anyone build *and verify* a Kiro ISO on any Arch-based system. The install-timing helper was the one build-scripts file still wired to a specific machine, with a literal SSH password and personal hostnames committed to a public repo — both a usability blocker for other users and a privacy leak. Generalizing the target/auth resolution removes the hardcoded identity while keeping the maintainer's one-word workflow intact: exporting `KIRO_SSH_USER` + `KIRO_SSH_PASS` once restores the `record-install-time.sh vm` shorthand exactly as before.

**Technical Details**
- `resolve_ssh()` is now a pure command-builder: it parses the `vm` keyword or `[user@]host[:port]` string, then layers flag → env → default for each of user, port, and password, and emits either a key-auth or password-auth SSH command. The package-missing check lives in `main()` (not inside the `$(…)` command substitution) so it can `exit` cleanly.
- Resolution verified across eight cases (vm key-auth, vm + env user/pass, `user@host`, `user@host:port`, bare host, `--user` override, `--password`, and target-user-beats-env precedence).

**Files Modified**
- `build-scripts/record-install-time.sh`

## 2026-06-06 — Remove the Btrfs warning + 10-second countdown from the build

**What Changed**
- Deleted the **`warn_btrfs()`** function and its call in `main()` in `build-the-iso.sh`. It used to scan `lsblk -f` for a Btrfs filesystem and, when found, print a "Btrfs filesystem detected" warning followed by a forced 10-second CTRL+C countdown before the build could continue.

**Why**
- The warning was a relic of an older concern that no longer applies — the build does not touch host filesystems in a way that endangers Btrfs, so the alarm and the mandatory 10-second stall just slowed every build on a Btrfs host with no real benefit.

**Files Modified**
- `build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh`

## 2026-06-06 — Refresh pacman databases in Phase 0 instead of inside `setup_cachyos`

**What Changed**
- Moved the `sudo pacman -Sy` database refresh out of **`setup_cachyos()`** in `host-prep.sh` and into the end of **`preflight_checks()`** (Phase 0) in `build-the-iso.sh`, where it now runs unconditionally on every host.

**Why**
- On a freshly installed host (the trigger was a just-installed **CachyOS** box) the pacman sync databases may not be populated yet, which breaks the later keyring and package installs. The refresh had been placed inside `setup_cachyos`, but that function short-circuits with an early `return` whenever `cachyos-keyring` + `cachyos-mirrorlist` are already present — which is exactly the case on CachyOS — so the line never ran on the system that needed it. Where it *did* run it was also redundant, since the preceding `pacman -Sy --needed ...` had already refreshed the databases.
- Putting a single unconditional `pacman -Sy` at the end of Phase 0 guarantees the sync DBs are populated before any repo-dependent step, on any Arch-based host.

## 2026-06-06 — Stop publishing `.claude/` (including memory) to GitHub

**What Changed**
- `.gitignore` now ignores the whole **`.claude/`** folder (single blanket line), replacing the previous `.claude/*` + `!.claude/memory/` pattern. That old negation was deliberately re-including `.claude/memory/` and pushing it to the public repo.
- Untracked the **6 `.claude/memory/*.md`** files that had been committed (`git rm -r --cached .claude`). The files remain on disk locally — only their tracking was removed.

**Why**
- This repo is public. The memory files are Claude working notes and feedback, not part of the ISO, and exposing the internal workflow online has no upside. The authoritative memory already lives at `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/`, so syncing a copy into the repo added nothing. The end-session workflow that used to perform that sync has been retired.
- Current-tree removal only; the files still exist in prior commit history, which is an accepted state — no history rewrite was performed.

**Files Modified**
- `.gitignore`
- `.claude/memory/` (6 files untracked)

## 2026-06-06 — Drop root `build.sh` wrapper; build entry point is `build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh`

**What Changed**
- Removed the root **`build.sh`** wrapper added earlier today. It was only a thin, template-conformant shim that `cd`'d into `build-scripts/` and ran `build-the-iso.sh` — it carried no build logic of its own (host-prep lives in `host-prep.sh`, sourced by `build-the-iso.sh`), so the indirection earned nothing.
- The build command is once again the documented, direct one: **`cd build-scripts && ./build-the-iso.sh`**.
- Updated **`README.md`** (Build Workflow block) and **`build-scripts/BYOI.md`** (all nine `./build.sh` references → `./build-the-iso.sh`) to use the correct script name.

**Why**
- A wrapper whose entire body is `cd build-scripts && ./build-the-iso.sh` adds a layer to maintain (and to keep byte-identical with `-next`) without simplifying anything for the builder. One canonical script is clearer than two.

**Files Modified**
- `build.sh` (removed)
- `README.md`, `build-scripts/BYOI.md`

## 2026-06-06 — Build hardening for clean Arch hosts: Chaotic 303-redirect fix, portable `$HOSTNAME` gate, Phase 0 preflight, `parallel_downloads` floor

**What Changed**
- **`get-pacman-repos-keys-and-mirrors.sh`** — the two filename-discovery calls now use **`curl -sL`** instead of `curl -s`. The Chaotic-AUR geo-mirror (`geo-mirror.chaotic.cx`) now answers with an **HTTP 303 redirect** to a regional mirror; `curl` does not follow redirects without `-L`, so the body came back empty, the `chaotic-keyring-*` / `chaotic-mirrorlist-*` parse matched nothing, and under `set -euo pipefail` the script died at the assignment **before** reaching its own friendly "Failed to resolve" guard — i.e. it exited silently with no error banner. `wget` (used for the actual package download) already follows redirects, so only the two `curl` parse lines needed fixing.
- **`build-the-iso.sh` — portable hostname gate.** The two `$(hostname)` checks (the `hq`-only skel `.bashrc` refresh in `main()`, and the `record_build_time` gate) now use the bash builtin **`$HOSTNAME`**. A minimal Arch host has no `hostname` binary (`inetutils` is not in `base`), so `$(hostname)` printed `command not found` to stderr on every clean-host build. Behavior is preserved (both gates still only fire on `hq`); the noise and fragility are gone.
- **`build-the-iso.sh` — new Phase 0 preflight (`preflight_checks`).** Before any of the long work, the build now fails fast with a clear message when **disk is low** (checks the least-free of `buildFolder` / `outFolder` against a 15 G minimum) or **there is no network** (probes `archlinux.org` and `github.com` with `wget --spider`). Previously a low-disk or offline host only surfaced the problem deep inside `mkarchiso`.
- **`build-the-iso.sh` — new `parallel_downloads` parameter.** A config-block knob (default `10`) that sets pacman `ParallelDownloads` in the **build-tree** `archiso/pacman.conf` (the file `mkarchiso` uses for the airootfs install — the one that governs the big package download), edited per-build so the committed repo file is never touched. It behaves as a **floor**: it only *raises* an active value that is lower than the target, or *enables* an inactive/commented/absent setting, and it **never lowers** a higher shipped value. When it does change something it alerts with an orange `log_warn`; a no-op is a quiet `log_info`.

**Why**
- `host-prep.sh` claims the build is "self-contained on any Arch-based host," but that path had never been exercised on a genuinely clean (non-`hq`) Arch box. Doing so surfaced two real breakages — the missing `hostname` binary and, more importantly, the Chaotic mirror's new 303 redirect, which fully blocked the build. Both are now fixed and the claim is verified.
- The preflight turns two common late failures (no space, no network) into immediate, legible errors.
- `ParallelDownloads` only meaningfully affects build speed when set in `archiso/pacman.conf`; exposing it as a floor lets a slow/stock host be sped up without ever regressing the value the repo already ships (currently `12`).

**Verification**
- Full end-to-end build on a clean, vanilla Arch host produced **`kiro-v26.06.06-x86_64.iso` (6.1 G)** with sha1/sha256/md5 + pkglist and **zero** errors. Phase 0 preflight ran green; the build sailed past the Chaotic fetch that the `curl -sL` fix unblocked. (`parallel_downloads` lands on the *next* build — that ISO was produced at the shipped `12`.)
- `parallel_downloads` floor logic dry-tested across all four states: active-12 → unchanged, active-5 → raised to 10, commented → enabled at 10, absent → added at 10.

**Files Modified**
- `build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh` — `$HOSTNAME` gate (×2), `preflight_checks` (Phase 0), `parallel_downloads` param + floor block in `prepare_build_tree`
- `build-scripts/get-pacman-repos-keys-and-mirrors.sh` — `curl -s` → `curl -sL` (×2)

## 2026-06-06 — Declutter repo root: move docs into `docs/` + drop stray `BEST_PRACTICES.md`

**What Changed**
- Moved **15 documentation files** off the repo root (via `git mv`, so history is preserved) — 14 into a structured **`docs/`** tree, and the build guide beside the build scripts:
  - `build-scripts/` — `BYOI.md` (the Build-Your-Own-ISO guide lives next to `build.sh` / `build-the-iso.sh`)
  - `docs/` — `OVERVIEW.md`, `WHAT-CHANGED-TO-THE-ISO.md`, `PIPEWIRE-MIGRATION.md`
  - `docs/kernels/` — `KERNEL_CHOICE_FOR_KIRO.md`, `KERNEL_COMPARISON.md`, `ARCH-KERNELS-BUILD-CONFIG-SCORECARD.md`, `CHATGPT-KERNEL-STUDY.md`, `GEMINI-KERNEL-STUDY.md`, `comparison-usage-kernels.md`, `LIQUORIX.md`
  - `docs/comparisons/` — `KIRO-VS-ARCH.md`, `KIRO-VS-CACHYOS.md`, `KIRO-VS-GARUDA.md`, `KIRO-VS-PRISM.md`
- Removed **`BEST_PRACTICES.md`** — a 166 KB stray copy of the Kiro-HQ best-practices file that did not belong in this repo (the canonical copy lives in Kiro-HQ; nothing here linked to it).
- Fixed every internal markdown link affected by the move — `README.md` → `docs/BYOI.md`, the relative links inside `docs/OVERVIEW.md`, `docs/WHAT-CHANGED-TO-THE-ISO.md`, and `docs/kernels/LIQUORIX.md`, and the historical links in this CHANGELOG. A link-resolution pass confirmed **zero** broken targets introduced by the reorg.

**Why**
- The root had grown to **22 `.md` files** — mostly kernel-research studies and `KIRO-VS-*` comparisons — burying the actual entry points. The root now holds only the 6 files that belong there (`README`, `CHANGELOG`, `CLAUDE`, `LICENSE`, plus the tooling-bound `RELEASES.md` / `DISTRO_TESTING.md` / `BUILD_TIMES.md`) and the three scripts (`build.sh`, `setup.sh`, `up.sh`).
- Files that other tooling reads/writes at fixed paths were deliberately **left at root**: `RELEASES.md` (feeds the website "Release notes" button), `DISTRO_TESTING.md` (`/kiro-ready`, `/kiro-check`), and `BUILD_TIMES.md` (`record-install-time.sh`).
- No effect on the ISO — these are repo docs only; the build pipeline references none of them.

**Files Modified**
- 15 docs relocated under `docs/` (renames); `BEST_PRACTICES.md` deleted
- Link fixes: `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/OVERVIEW.md`, `docs/WHAT-CHANGED-TO-THE-ISO.md`, `docs/kernels/LIQUORIX.md`

## 2026-06-06 — One-command build (`./build.sh`) + host-prep extracted to a sourced helper (mirrored from `-next`)

**What Changed**
- Added **`build.sh`** at the repo root as the single entry point for building the ISO — a thin, template-conformant wrapper that hands off to **`build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh`**, so the command is identical on every machine: **`./build.sh`**. A builder no longer needs to know the internal layout or `cd` into `build-scripts/`.
- Extracted the host-preparation helpers (**`ensure_package`**, **`setup_chaotic`**, and the new **`setup_cachyos`**) out of `build-the-iso.sh` into a new **`build-scripts/host-prep.sh`**, which `build-the-iso.sh` now **sources**. `host-prep.sh` is a function-only library (no `main()`) with a load-once guard, keeping all "make the host ready to build" logic in one place.
- Wired **`setup_cachyos`** into `main()` alongside `setup_chaotic`. It trusts the CachyOS signing key, enables the `[cachyos]` CDN77 geo-mirror in `/etc/pacman.conf` if absent, and installs `cachyos-keyring` + `cachyos-mirrorlist` — idempotently (already-configured hosts are detected and skipped).

**Why**
- The build pulls `linux-cachyos` (the default live kernel) from `[cachyos]`, and `prepopulate_keyring` runs `pacman-key --populate cachyos`; a host lacking the cachyos keyring/mirrorlist fails the build. Folding that prep into the sourced helper makes the build **self-contained on any Arch-based host** (Arch, Kiro, EndeavourOS, CachyOS, Garuda) with no manual setup.
- This mirrors the change proven on **`kiro-iso-next`** (which produced today's working v26.06.06 build). The two ISO build pipelines stay structurally identical so a fix in one ports cleanly to the other. **Note:** `build.sh` and `host-prep.sh` are intentionally byte-identical across both repos for now — a future unified `kiro-iso-builder` is the place to collapse this duplication into a single source of truth.

**Files Modified**
- `build.sh` (new)
- `build-scripts/host-prep.sh` (new)

## 2026-06-06 — v26.06.06 — risk-tier `packages.x86_64` reorg from `-next` + drop paid app

**Release** — production ISO **`kiro-v26.06.06`** built and verified release-ready. Headline change: **`spotify` removed** — a paid streaming app has no place on the community ISO. `/kiro-ready` returned **GO** (5 repos clean+pushed, no P1 blockers, no iso↔iso-next drift, name-leakage 0 Tier-1/3) and a clean **full install** passed `kiro-audit` **134 / 0 / 0**, with the shipped `kiro-system-files 26.06-15` sysctl config verified byte-identical to source. See [DISTRO_TESTING.md](DISTRO_TESTING.md).

**What Changed**
- Reorganized **`archiso/packages.x86_64`** into the same **three risk tiers** now used on `kiro-iso-next` (FROZEN / KIRO CORE / USER-CHANGEABLE), grouped by function within each tier, with banner comments that make the "never remove" packages unmistakable and push the freely-editable apps to the end.
- Removed **`spotify`** — a paid streaming app has no place on the community ISO that ships to users.
- Pruned the trailing commented-out "uncomment-to-enable" optionals (`#flat-remix`, `#colloid-cursors-git`, `#dex`, `#ckb-next-git`, `#discord`, `#telegram-desktop`, `#tlp`) — personal-taste suggestions that belong in the arcolinux-nemesis post-install scripts.
- Kept production's plain package names (**`calamares`**, **`kiro-calamares-config`**, **`kiro-calamares-tweak-tool`**, **`plymouth-theme-kiro-logo`**) — no `-next`/`-nemesis` variants on production.

**Why**
- The list gave no signal telling a builder which packages are load-bearing vs safe to edit. Tiering makes the blast radius explicit. The structure was proven on `-next` first (build succeeded, files verified) before mirroring here, per the test-in-next-first rule.
- Built from the `-next` file with the four production name swaps, then a **token-set diff** confirmed the only deltas from the previously-validated production list were the intended ones: `spotify` removed (active) and the 7 commented optionals removed — **zero** other packages lost, added, or toggled. Build-script anchors (`nvidia-*`, `linux-cachyos`/`-headers`) stay at column 0.
- Result: **396 active** packages (was 397), 36 commented (was 43). Production and `-next` now differ by exactly the four by-design Calamares/Plymouth name pairs and nothing else.

## 2026-05-31 — Three NVIDIA boot options: proprietary modern / proprietary auto-detect

**What Changed**
- The single NVIDIA boot entry split into two, across all three bootloaders (systemd-boot, GRUB, syslinux): **"NVIDIA proprietary, modern"** (`driver=nonfree`) keeps the baked `nvidia-open-dkms` with no chwd — the proven path for Turing / RTX-20-series+ cards; and a new **"NVIDIA proprietary, auto-detect"** (`driver=nonfreechwd`) that runs chwd to pick the right driver for any card. The open entry is unchanged (`driver=free`, "open source: AMD / Intel").

**Why**
- Modern-NVIDIA users get a chwd-free express lane to the baked driver (proven on real hardware), while the chwd path stays available for older cards. The driver-mode logic lives in [kiro-calamares-config](../kiro-calamares-config); this repo just adds/relabels the boot entries.

**Files Modified**
- `archiso/efiboot/loader/entries/02-nvidianouveau.conf` (relabel) + `02b-nvidiachwd.conf` (new)
- `archiso/grub/grub.cfg`, `archiso/syslinux/archiso_sys-linux.cfg`

## 2026-05-29 — Dark Calamares installer: ship KiroDark Kvantum theme (mirrored from beta)

**What Changed**

Promoted from `kiro-iso-next` after a confirmed install + reboot. The Calamares installer now renders dark (navy + sky-blue, matching the website). The ISO ships a custom **KiroDark** Kvantum theme for root, which the installer (run as root via pkexec) picks up via `-style kvantum`.

**Technical Details**

- New: `airootfs/root/.config/Kvantum/KiroDark/{KiroDark.kvconfig,KiroDark.svg}` + `kvantum.kvconfig` (`theme=KiroDark`). KiroDark = ArcDark remapped to Kiro's navy/sky-blue palette, fully opaque, white button text.
- `packages.x86_64`: added `kvantum` (qt6 style) explicitly — was only present as a dependency of `kvantum-qt5`; Calamares is Qt6 and needs the qt6 Kvantum style.
- Paired with `kiro-calamares-config` (dark branding) and the production `calamares` package launcher change (`-style kvantum`, wrapper removed). `kiro_final` strips the theme from the installed system.

**Files Modified**
- `archiso/airootfs/root/.config/Kvantum/KiroDark/KiroDark.kvconfig` (new)
- `archiso/airootfs/root/.config/Kvantum/KiroDark/KiroDark.svg` (new)

## 2026-05-29 — Sync committed skel `.bashrc` with the renamed kiro-* helpers

**What Changed**

Updated the committed **[archiso/airootfs/etc/skel/.bashrc](archiso/airootfs/etc/skel/.bashrc)** so its aliases point at the renamed `kiro-*` helper scripts instead of the old `edu-*` names (and dropped the dead `rvariety`/`rkmix`/`rconky` aliases, whose `edu-remove-*` scripts were removed, not renamed). This is purely a sync change — at build time `build-the-iso.sh` fetches the live `.bashrc-latest` from `erikdubois/edu-shells` into the build tree, so the *shipped* `.bashrc` always comes from edu-shells. The point of this edit is the **Phase 2c consistency check** (`files_are_identical` against the local edu-shells `.bashrc-latest`): without it, that check would print NOK once edu-shells is pushed with the renamed aliases. Real fix lives in (and must be pushed from) `edu-shells`.

**Technical Details**

- Renames (old → new): `edu-which-vga` → `kiro-which-vga`; `edu-fix-pacman-databases-and-keys` → `kiro-fix-pacman-keys` (7 alias variants); `edu-fix-pacman-conf` → `kiro-fix-pacman-conf`; `edu-fix-pacman-gpg-conf` → `kiro-fix-gpg-conf`; `edu-fix-archlinux-servers` → `kiro-fix-mirrors`; `edu-probe` → `kiro-probe`. File still parses clean (`bash -n`).

## 2026-05-29 — Live ISO boot now shows the K splash too

**What Changed**

Completed the boot-splash story: the `kiro-logo` Plymouth splash now renders during the **live ISO boot**, not just on the installed system. Until now Plymouth was present and themed on the ISO but never drew at live boot, because the live environment was missing the two prerequisites Plymouth needs — the `plymouth` initramfs hook and the `splash` kernel parameter. Both were only added to the *installed* target (by the `kiro_plymouth` Calamares module + the bootloader module). This change adds them to the live boot path as well.

**Technical Details**

- **[archiso/airootfs/etc/mkinitcpio.conf](archiso/airootfs/etc/mkinitcpio.conf)** — inserted the `plymouth` hook right after `udev` in the live `HOOKS` line (same position the `kiro_plymouth` Calamares module uses on the target). `kms` is already present, so KMS is ready before Plymouth draws. `mkarchiso` rebuilds the live initramfs at build time, so no manual `mkinitcpio` run is needed.
- **`quiet splash`** added to the **KMS** boot entries across all three bootloaders. Plymouth needs *both* `quiet` and `splash` or it falls back to the text details theme:
  - systemd-boot (**[archiso/efiboot/loader/entries/](archiso/efiboot/loader/entries/)**): `01-archiso-linux`, `02-nvidianouveau`, `04-fallback-zen` (these already had `quiet loglevel=3`, so only `splash` was added).
  - GRUB (**[archiso/grub/grub.cfg](archiso/grub/grub.cfg)**) and syslinux (**[archiso/syslinux/archiso_sys-linux.cfg](archiso/syslinux/archiso_sys-linux.cfg)**): these had neither token, so `quiet splash` was appended to the matching free / NVIDIA / zen-fallback entries.
- **`03-nomodeset` is intentionally left untouched** in every bootloader. With `nomodeset` there is no KMS, so Plymouth cannot render graphically — leaving that entry bare keeps the safe-graphics fallback verbose and reliable.
- Theme selection is unchanged — `kiro-logo` is still set at `mkarchiso` time by the `plymouth-theme-kiro-logo` package's `.install`. This change only makes the live boot actually *display* it.

## 2026-05-29 — Kiro boot splash now ships on the ISO

**What Changed**

Added `plymouth-theme-kiro-logo` to [archiso/packages.x86_64](archiso/packages.x86_64) (new PLYMOUTH section). Its `depends=('plymouth')` pulls plymouth onto the ISO automatically, so installed systems get the animated "self-assembling K" boot splash out of the box. Mirrored into the `kiro-iso-next` tree.

**Technical Details**

- The package's `.install` runs `plymouth-set-default-theme kiro-logo` at `mkarchiso` time, writing `Theme=kiro-logo` into the airootfs `/etc/plymouth/plymouthd.conf`; `unpackfs` copies that to the target before the initramfs is built. No `-R` is used (correct — Calamares' `initcpio` job is the single source of truth for the target rebuild).
- The `plymouth` hook is added to the target's `mkinitcpio.conf` by the new `kiro_plymouth` Calamares module (see kiro-calamares-config CHANGELOG); the `splash` kernel param is auto-appended by the `bootloader` module when plymouth is present. Splash is kernel-agnostic — the single `mkinitcpio -P` builds it into every selected kernel's initramfs.

## 2026-05-29 — chwd NVIDIA testing on worf + nvidia-390xx is dead on the 7.0 kernel

Test install on **worf** (`erik-p7624`, an Optimus laptop: Intel HD 2nd-gen + NVIDIA **GF108M / GeForce GT 620M**, PCI `10de:0de9`), booted with the **non-free** GRUB option (`driver=nonfree`). Three things came out of it.

### chwd behaved correctly — and our DKMS patch shipped

The Calamares log confirms chwd ran (`Kernel parameter 'driver' = nonfree` → `chwd --autoconfigure`) and made the right calls per device: `intel` for the iGPU and **`nouveau` for the GT 620M**. chwd's device database classifies that Fermi card as a nouveau card, *not* a 390xx card, so it never tried to install a proprietary NVIDIA driver — it pulled `nouveau-fw` + mesa/opencl and finished cleanly. The installed system runs on Intel `i915` + Xorg `modesetting`; the display is healthy.

The installed box carries **`chwd 1.21.0-4`** (our patched build) and its `/var/lib/chwd/db/pci/graphic_drivers/profiles.toml` shows the **patched** `[nvidia-open-dkms]` block — `echo "nvidia-open-dkms"` + per-kernel `-headers`, with the old `${kernel}-nvidia-open` prebuilt logic gone. So the chwd DKMS patch built correctly and reached the ISO. `linux-cachyos-nvidia-open` is not installed.

**Caveat — still untested end-to-end:** worf does *not* exercise the patch, because its card went to nouveau, so the `nvidia-open-dkms` profile never fired. Confirming the patch *in action* (installs `nvidia-open-dkms` + headers, never `linux-cachyos-nvidia-open`) needs a **modern NVIDIA GPU** that chwd routes to that profile.

### nvidia-390xx (390.157) cannot build on Kiro's 7.0 kernel

Manually installing `nvidia-390xx-dkms 390.157` on worf left DKMS at `added` (never built); `nvidia-smi` then reports "couldn't communicate with the NVIDIA driver". A forced `dkms build` fails with:

```
nvidia/os-interface.c:1136: error: 'screen_info' undeclared
```

`screen_info` was removed from modern kernels; the EOL 390 branch still references it. **The legacy 390 driver is therefore non-viable on Kiro's kernel** — for Fermi-class cards like the GT 620M, **nouveau is the only working driver**, which is exactly what chwd picks. (worf was left as-is; no cleanup applied.)

**Implication:** the `nvidia_driver=390xx` option in **[build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh](build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh)** and chwd's `nvidia-dkms-390xx` profile are effectively dead on the 7.0 kernel — any card routed there would get a driverless system (now non-fatal at install, but still no proprietary driver). `nvidia-dkms-470xx` is likely the same and needs verifying. See TODO.

## 2026-05-28 — Hardware-aware install via **chwd** (synced from `kiro-iso-next`)

Mirror of the same-date `kiro-iso-next` change. The chwd Calamares integration validated in `kiro-iso-next` + `kiro-calamares-config-next` is now ready for production: this commit syncs the four package additions to `archiso/packages.x86_64` so the live ISO carries everything `kiro-calamares-config`'s new `chwd` Calamares module needs at install time + leaves on the target for post-install rerun via `sudo chwd -a`.

### What Changed

Four edits to **[archiso/packages.x86_64](archiso/packages.x86_64)**:

- **Enabled `b43-fwcutter`** (was commented) — Broadcom B43/B43legacy firmware extractor for older Broadcom Wi-Fi chipsets.
- **Enabled `broadcom-wl-dkms`** (was commented) — Broadcom proprietary `wl` kernel module via DKMS. chwd's `broadcom-wl` profile (priority 1) expects this to be available.
- **Added `chwd`** — CachyOS's Hardware Detection Tool (Rust, GPL-3.0). Pulled from `nemesis_repo` where it ships with our patched profiles.toml fixing the upstream `[virtualbox]` / `[vmware]` vendor_id swap.
- **Added `hwdetect`** — console hardware-detect helper, complements `hwinfo` / `inxi` / `hw-probe`.

### Why

Same rationale as the `kiro-iso-next` entry: chwd picks the right NVIDIA / AMD / Intel / Broadcom / hybrid-PRIME variant at install time based on detected hardware. Removes the need for per-build `nvidia_driver=open|580xx|390xx` selection in `build-the-iso.sh` once chwd is fully trusted (retirement TODO already filed in kiro-iso-next).

### Pairs With

- [kiro-calamares-config](../kiro-calamares-config/) — committed the chwd Calamares module + settings.conf sequence entry in the same session.
- [edu-pkgbuild-3party/chwd](../../EDU-PKG-BUILD/edu-pkgbuild-3party/chwd/) — patched chwd PKGBUILD in nemesis_repo (vbox/vmware vendor_id fix).

**Files Modified**

- **[archiso/packages.x86_64](archiso/packages.x86_64)** — uncommented `b43-fwcutter` (line 5), uncommented `broadcom-wl-dkms` (line 11), added `chwd` (line 523), added `hwdetect` (line 529).

## 2026-05-28 — Live-boot fallback kernel: `linux-zen` entries added to UEFI / BIOS-syslinux / GRUB menus

### What changed

A 4th entry, **"fallback kernel linux-zen"**, was added to each live boot menu so a user whose hardware refuses `linux-cachyos` can pick `linux-zen` at the boot screen — not just post-install. Three additions:

- **UEFI:** new file [archiso/efiboot/loader/entries/04-fallback-zen.conf](archiso/efiboot/loader/entries/04-fallback-zen.conf) (sort-key 04, mirrors 01-archiso-linux.conf's open-source / KMS-on driver combo with `vmlinuz-linux-zen`)
- **BIOS/syslinux:** new `LABEL arch_fallback_zen` block appended to [archiso/syslinux/archiso_sys-linux.cfg](archiso/syslinux/archiso_sys-linux.cfg), wrapped in `# >>> KIRO_ZEN_FALLBACK_BEGIN/END <<<` markers
- **GRUB:** new `menuentry` with id `'kirofallback'` inserted into [archiso/grub/grub.cfg](archiso/grub/grub.cfg), same marker pair

The PXE syslinux config and the GRUB loopback.cfg were left alone — niche boot paths where a user can edit the kernel parameter at the GRUB/syslinux prompt if they need to.

A small **strip-step** was added to `apply_kernel()` in [build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh](build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh): if the user sets `kernel=` to something that excludes `linux-zen`, the new UEFI file is deleted and the marker-wrapped blocks are sed-deleted from syslinux/grub before `mkarchiso` runs. Keeps the build robust to non-default `kernel=` settings without leaving broken boot entries pointing at an uninstalled kernel.

### Why

A fallback kernel only serves its purpose if it's reachable from the live-ISO boot menu. Having `linux-zen` installed in the squashfs but with no boot entry means a user whose hardware refuses cachyos can't even reach Calamares to install — making the "fallback" useless in exactly the scenario that matters.

The design is informed by CachyOS's own live ISO ([CachyOS/CachyOS-Live-ISO](https://github.com/CachyOS/CachyOS-Live-ISO/blob/master/archiso/grub/grub.cfg)), which ships their main kernel + an LTS fallback in the same boot menu for the same reason. We kept Kiro's three existing entries (open-source / NVIDIA / nomodeset) intact and added zen as a 4th, rather than collapsing the kernel-fallback and graphics-fallback axes into one entry as CachyOS does — Erik's call, to keep both axes orthogonal so a user can pick "kernel-only fallback" without losing modeset.

## 2026-05-28 — Default kernel: `linux-lqx` → `linux-cachyos`

### What changed

The ISO's canonical kernel was switched from `linux-lqx` (Liquorix) to `linux-cachyos`. Both [build-the-iso.sh](build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh) (lines 369-370) and every load-bearing archiso template were updated:

- **Builder:** `KERNEL_CANDIDATES` dropped `linux-lqx`; `CANONICAL_KERNEL` set to `linux-cachyos`. The cachyos family (`-bore`, `-lts`, `-rc`) continues to be discovered dynamically from the enabled repos at picker time — no static list change needed.
- **Package list:** `archiso/packages.x86_64` lines 52 and 134 now install `linux-cachyos` + `linux-cachyos-headers`.
- **Boot configs (templates):** 9 files mass-rewritten from `linux-lqx` → `linux-cachyos` — `archiso/efiboot/loader/entries/{01-archiso-linux,02-nvidianouveau,03-nomodeset}.conf`, `archiso/syslinux/archiso_{sys,pxe}-linux.cfg`, `archiso/grub/{grub,loopback}.cfg`, `archiso/airootfs/etc/mkinitcpio.d/{linux.preset,kiro}`.

### Why

Why now: latest test ISO showed the picker pre-selecting `linux-lqx` (the canonical), and the builder's auto-rewrite logic at `apply_kernel()` (line 526) only fires when the user's pick differs from the canonical — so the default build path was emitting `linux-lqx`-based boot entries unchanged. With cachyos chosen as the new community default (responsiveness + active upstream + healthier security track than lqx), the canonical needs to match that decision so the default flow produces a cachyos ISO without depending on the user picking it explicitly.

The build-time default `kernel=` is now `"linux-cachyos linux-zen"` — both kernels are installed in the live ISO by default. `linux-zen` is the chosen fallback for users whose hardware doesn't accept cachyos; see the separate entry below for the live-boot-menu wiring that exposes it at boot time.

LIQUORIX.md is retained as a historical record of the prior kernel era; a header note flags it as superseded.

## 2026-05-28 — squashfs compression L6 → L3 (faster unpackfs phase)

### What changed

One-line change in [archiso/profiledef.sh](archiso/profiledef.sh) (line 19): the squashfs build options swapped `-Xcompression-level 6` for `-Xcompression-level 3`. The old L6 line is preserved as a commented fallback right above the new line, so reverting is one-line.

### Why

`unpackfs` (the squashfs extract during Calamares install) is the dominant cost on slow disks — easily ~2 min of the install. zstd decompression speed scales inversely with compression level; dropping L6 → L3 typically yields 2-3× faster extraction at the cost of ~5-10% ISO size growth. For a once-downloaded-many-times-installed artifact that trade is worthwhile.

### Benefit observed

ISO size: 5.9 GB → **6.1 GB** (+200 MB, ~3.4% growth — on the low end of the predicted 5-10%). Unpackfs phase on the VirtualBox test install measured at **2 min 13 s** (total install 3 min 4 s). Direct head-to-head against the prior L6 baseline on the same VM has not been run yet; the size impact is confirmed at the cost predicted, and the option is in place for further benchmarking.

## 2026-05-28 — KIRO-VS-GARUDA.md analysis added

### What changed

New comparison document [`KIRO-VS-GARUDA.md`](docs/comparisons/KIRO-VS-GARUDA.md), joining the `KIRO-VS-ARCH` / `KIRO-VS-CACHYOS` / `KIRO-VS-PRISM` series. SSH-based inspection of Garuda Mokka's tuning footprint, scored against `edu-system-files`.

### Why

Reference distros are checked quarterly so good ideas don't drift past us. This round produced 5 adoptions (implemented same day in `edu-system-files`): systemd-oomd enablement + tuning, Intel ME blacklist (mei/mei_me), `btusb reset=1`, kernel-zswap disable tmpfile, NetworkManager `unmanaged-lo`. Also formalised the **kernel-agnostic rule** (every system tweak must work on any kernel a user might run) and recorded it in the analysis doc + `edu-system-files/CLAUDE.md`.

## 2026-05-28 — default kernel switched: linux-lqx → linux-cachyos + linux-zen

### What changed

The ISO's default kernel is now **`linux-cachyos`** (live-boot + post-install default), with **`linux-zen`** shipped as a secondary installed kernel the user can boot from the boot loader menu. Liquorix (`linux-lqx`) is no longer the default.

### Why

Two clear choices, both from repos Kiro already trusts: `linux-zen` lives in Arch `[extra]` (zero third-party trust burden), `linux-cachyos` comes via `chaotic-aur` which is already in the ISO's pacman.conf. Killing lqx removes the third-party `liquorix.net` repo / AUR-build complexity and the special-case docs around it. The narrative tightens too: *"fastest desktop → cachyos, conservative stock-Arch → zen"* sells itself in a way *"what's Liquorix?"* never did. Both kernels have been independently tested across many combinations.

### How — single-line change

The build is fully templated. One line in [build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh](build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh) (line 101):

```bash
kernel="linux-cachyos linux-zen"   # was: "linux-lqx"
```

`apply_kernel()` (line 514+) rewrites at build time:
- `packages.x86_64` — strips the canonical kernel + headers, adds every selected kernel + its headers
- live mkinitcpio presets in `airootfs/etc/mkinitcpio.d/`
- all boot loader entries (`efiboot/loader/entries/`, `grub/grub.cfg`, `grub/loopback.cfg`, `syslinux/*.cfg`)

`CANONICAL_KERNEL=linux-lqx` (line 370) is **untouched** — it's the *source token* the sed-templating substitutes FROM, matching the literal kernel name in the archiso tree as-shipped. Changing it would break the substitution.

### Calamares side: nothing needed

`kiro_kernel` (in `kiro-calamares-config`) is already kernel-agnostic — it detects whichever kernel(s) the live medium ships and installs them into the target, with the live-boot kernel becoming the post-install default. So this build-script change propagates all the way through to the installed system without touching Calamares.

### Files modified

- `build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh` (line 101)
- `TODO.md` (closed the "Choose a different kernel" item)
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this entry)

### Follow-ups (separate passes, not on this commit)

- Retire `LIQUORIX.md` / fold `KERNEL_CHOICE_FOR_KIRO.md` into a decision-archive note — the new default makes them historical.
- `KIRO-VS-CACHYOS.md` — invert the comparison: Kiro now ships CachyOS's kernel; the doc should be reframed as *"what Kiro adds on top of the CachyOS kernel choice"*.
- Mirror this kernel default into `kiro-iso-next` once we're happy with the June-1 build.
- `WHAT-CHANGED-TO-THE-ISO.md` entry will be appended in the standard next-release pass.

## 2026-05-28 — launcher trust moved out of airootfs; kernel selector hardening

### Launcher trust: out of airootfs, into the calamares package

Yesterday's "pre-trust the Install kiro launcher" fix — an airootfs autostart `.desktop` running `/usr/local/bin/kiro-trust-desktop-launchers` — **did not survive a real build**. The airootfs overlay shipped the helper as `644` even though git records it `100755`, so the autostart's `Exec=<script>` couldn't execute it and the "Untrusted application launcher" prompt came right back. The exec bit is simply not reliable through the airootfs overlay.

So the helper is **removed from this repo's airootfs** (`archiso/airootfs/usr/local/bin/kiro-trust-desktop-launchers` deleted), and trust is now delivered by the **`calamares` package** as a **systemd _user_ service** (`kiro-trust-launchers.service`, installed to `~liveuser/.config/systemd/user/` with a shipped `WantedBy` enable symlink). Two deliberate design points:

- **`ExecStart=/bin/bash /usr/local/bin/kiro-trust-desktop-launchers`** — running the script through `bash` makes the exec bit irrelevant, so the lost-`+x` class of bug can't recur.
- **User service, `default.target`** — the trust action is `gio set metadata::trusted` on liveuser's desktop files, which is per-user via the session bus (a root system service writes to the wrong place). The unit targets **`default.target`** because XFCE on Kiro does **not** activate `graphical-session.target` (verified live: the service was `enabled` but stayed `inactive (dead)`).

The trigger and helper thus leave kiro-iso's airootfs entirely; the calamares package owns the mechanism. (See the calamares PKGBUILD for the unit + symlink.)

### Kernel selector: strict validation + no needless repo scan

Refinements to `select_kernels()` in the build script:

- **Strict `picker=` validation** — an invalid value (e.g. a typo'd `diag`) now fails loudly with `Invalid picker='diag'. Valid options: auto | gum | dialog` instead of silently falling back to gum.
- **Kernel-name validation** — a mistyped `kernel="…"` is caught up front with `Unknown kernel '<name>'` plus the list of valid names, rather than failing deep inside `mkarchiso`.
- **No needless repo scan** — `detect_available_kernels` (which probes ~25 packages) no longer runs on every build. A fixed kernel like `linux-lqx` now does just two local-DB lookups to confirm the package + `-headers` exist; the full enumeration runs only for `kernel="ask"` (build the menu) or on a typo (suggest valid names).
- **`auto` now prefers `dialog`** — `picker="auto"` resolves to dialog (Kiro's branded picker) if present, else gum; `picker="gum"` still forces the truecolor UI.

**Files Modified**

- **[build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh](./build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh)** — picker + kernel validation, `detect_available_kernels` moved out of the fixed-kernel path, `auto` dispatch flipped to dialog-first.
- **archiso/airootfs/usr/local/bin/kiro-trust-desktop-launchers** — removed (trust now ships via the calamares package).

## 2026-05-27 — kernel selector: `picker=` toggle + broader dynamic discovery

Two refinements to the `kernel="ask"` selector:

**1. `picker=` config var** (`auto` | `gum` | `dialog`). `auto` (default) uses gum if installed, else dialog; set it explicitly to force one — `dialog` to test that path or run on a host without gum, `gum` to insist on the truecolor UI. Previously the choice was implicit (`command -v gum`).

**2. Broader, fully-dynamic kernel discovery.** The selector now offers every kernel in the **first four families** the enabled repos provide, discovered dynamically (no stale hardcoded list): the mainstream set plus all **CachyOS**, **XanMod**, and **pinned-LTS** flavors. Static candidates are now just the stable mainstream names (`linux`, `-lts`, `-zen`, `-hardened`, `-rt`, `-rt-lts`, `-lqx`, `-mainline`); the multi-flavor families are matched dynamically via `^(linux-cachyos|linux-xanmod|linux-lts[0-9])`.

**What we deliberately leave out, and why.** The repos also ship CPU-microarch builds (`linux-x64v2/v3/v4`, `linux-znver2…5`) and niche kernels (`linux-cjktty`, `-nitrous`, `-tachyon`, `-vfio`). These are **excluded by design**: low demand, and the microarch ones are **dangerous on a general ISO — they silently fail to boot on the wrong CPU level** (e.g. `x64v4` needs AVX-512, `znver5` needs Zen 5). Anyone who explicitly wants one can still set `kernel="linux-znver4"` directly.

**Files Modified**

- **[build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh](./build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh)** — `picker=` config var; `KERNEL_CANDIDATES` trimmed to mainstream + `linux-mainline`; dynamic grep widened to CachyOS/XanMod/LTS-pins; picker-aware dispatch in `select_kernels`.

## 2026-05-27 — kernel selector: gum picker (truecolor Arc Dark) with dialog fallback

`select_kernels()` now prefers **`gum`** for the `kernel="ask"` picker, falling back to **`dialog`** when gum isn't installed. gum renders **truecolor**, so it hits the exact Arc Dark palette the dialog theme could only approximate through the terminal's 16 colors: blue accent `#5294e2`, text `#d3dae3`, muted header `#8b9bb4`. Refactored into `_select_kernels_gum` (`gum choose --no-limit`, with a second `gum choose` for the live-boot kernel when several are picked) and `_select_kernels_dialog` (the existing checklist/radiolist, unchanged). The parent runs `detect_available_kernels` once, then dispatches on `command -v gum`. gum is host-only and not in the ISO — fine, since the selector runs host-side at build time; the `dialog` path keeps a bare build host working.

**Files Modified**

- **[build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh](./build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh)** — split `select_kernels` into gum + dialog backends.

## 2026-05-27 — live ISO: pre-trust the "Install kiro" launcher

Clicking the **Install kiro** desktop launcher on the live ISO popped XFCE/Thunar's **"Untrusted application launcher"** dialog (_"…is in an insecure location and not marked as secure"_) before Calamares would start — an avoidable speed bump on first contact with the installer. Thunar 4.20 refuses to launch a `.desktop` unless it carries the GIO trust metadata, and `cal-kiro.desktop` (shipped by the calamares package, already `chmod 755`) had none.

Added a tiny live-session autostart — **[/usr/local/bin/kiro-trust-desktop-launchers](./archiso/airootfs/usr/local/bin/kiro-trust-desktop-launchers)**, launched by **[~/.config/autostart/trust-desktop-launchers.desktop](./archiso/airootfs/home/liveuser/.config/autostart/trust-desktop-launchers.desktop)** (liveuser only) — that sets both `metadata::trusted=true` and the XFCE-specific `metadata::xfce-exe-checksum` on every `~/Desktop/*.desktop` at login. The checksum is computed **at runtime** so it always matches the current file (a value baked at build time would break the moment the launcher changes). Confirmed on the live VM (Thunar 4.20.8): with the flags set the launcher opens straight into Calamares, no prompt. **Live-session scope only** — not shipped to `/etc/skel`, so installed systems are unaffected. Mirrored to `kiro-iso-next`.

**Files Modified**

- **[archiso/airootfs/usr/local/bin/kiro-trust-desktop-launchers](./archiso/airootfs/usr/local/bin/kiro-trust-desktop-launchers)** (new)
- **[archiso/airootfs/home/liveuser/.config/autostart/trust-desktop-launchers.desktop](./archiso/airootfs/home/liveuser/.config/autostart/trust-desktop-launchers.desktop)** (new)

## 2026-05-27 — kernel-agnostic ISO: build-time kernel selector

[build-the-iso.sh](./build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh) no longer hardcodes `linux-lqx`. A new **`kernel=`** config knob (default `linux-lqx`; set to `ask` for an interactive **`dialog`** menu, or a space-separated list for several kernels) lets the ISO be built with **any kernel(s)** the enabled repos offer. This pairs with the new **`kiro_kernel`** Calamares module in `kiro-calamares-config`, which installs whatever kernel(s) the ISO ships — together the whole pipeline (live ISO + installed system) becomes kernel-agnostic from a single selection point, with **zero edits to the config**.

**How it works.** `select_kernels()` detects installable kernels by probing a candidate list (`linux`, `-lts`, `-zen`, `-hardened`, `-rt`, `-rt-lts`, `-lqx`, `-cachyos`) plus **every `linux-cachyos*` flavor discovered dynamically** — CachyOS kernels topped our benchmark study, so all flavors are exposed and discovered at build time rather than hardcoded into a list that goes stale. Only kernels with a matching `-headers` are offered (the DKMS NVIDIA drivers need them). When several are picked, a second `dialog` chooses which one the **live ISO boots** (the "primary"). `apply_kernel()` then rewrites the **build-tree** copies (never the repo source): all selected kernels + `-headers` into [packages.x86_64](./archiso/packages.x86_64), and the primary kernel name into the boot entries (`efiboot`/`syslinux`/`grub`) and the live presets (`kiro`, `linux.preset`). The repo keeps `linux-lqx` as its canonical default, mirroring the existing `inject_nvidia_packages()` pattern. The picker is host-only (terminal-native `dialog`, so it works over SSH/tty) and themed via a bundled **[kiro.dialogrc](./build-scripts/kiro.dialogrc)** (dark background, blue accents).

**Validated on the `-next` track first** — built ISOs with CachyOS (single) and `linux-lts` + `linux-zen` (multi), installed and booted both, confirming `kiro_kernel` lays down every kernel's image, initramfs, and intact headers — then mirrored here for production.

**Files Modified**

- **[build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh](./build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh)** — `kernel=` config var; `detect_available_kernels()`, `select_kernels()`, `apply_kernel()`; wired into `main()` + `show_overview`.
- **[build-scripts/kiro.dialogrc](./build-scripts/kiro.dialogrc)** — new dark dialog theme for the picker.

## 2026-05-27 — build: pre-flight version-sync check

[build-the-iso.sh](./build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh) now runs a **`verify_version_sync()`** guard immediately after `apply_version_bump()` (logged as **Phase 2b**), before any of the expensive build phases. It extracts the version string from all four authoritative sources — `ISO_RELEASE=` in **dev-rel**, `iso_version=` and `iso_label=` in **profiledef.sh**, and `kiroVersion=` in **build-the-iso.sh** itself — and asserts they all equal the in-memory `${kiroVersion}` that drives the build (with `iso_label` checked as `${iso_name}-${version}`). Any mismatch prints the offending file/value list and **hard-aborts with `exit 1`** before `mkarchiso` runs.

**Why:** the version lives in three files that must stay in lockstep (documented in CLAUDE.md). When `bump_version="yes"` the bump re-stamps all of them, so they can't drift — but on a `bump_version="no"` same-day rebuild, a hand-edited or half-reverted version string survives silently and only surfaces as a confusing failure (or a mislabelled ISO) deep into the build. Failing fast at Phase 2b turns a ~20-minute wasted build into an instant, explicit error. The check is cheap enough to run unconditionally, so it also doubles as a self-test that `apply_version_bump()`'s `sed` rewrites actually landed.

Also added compact colored status helpers (**`status_ok`** → green `[ OK ]`, **`status_nok`** → red `[ NOK ]`) and wired them into **`remove_buildfolder()`**: a green `[ OK ]` prints before the "Deleting build folder" banner when the folder is present, and a red `[ NOK ]` (replacing the previous blue info banner) when there is nothing to delete.

Added a reusable **`files_are_identical()`** helper — a byte-for-byte exact-copy check (`cmp -s`) between two paths that guards both paths first and reports green `[ OK ]` / red `[ NOK ]`. Returns 0/non-zero for use in an `if`. Wired into `main()` as **Phase 2c**, comparing the committed skel `.bashrc` against the local **`~/EDU/edu-shells`** clone (`.bashrc-latest`); the call is followed by `|| true` so a `[ NOK ]` (drift, or no local clone) is purely informational and never aborts the build.

## 2026-05-27 — kernel docs: validation summary, comparison reconciliation, scheduler fix

Docs-only day, all centred on the kernel story. No build artifacts affected, no rebuild needed.

### LIQUORIX.md — validation summary consolidated

[LIQUORIX.md](./docs/kernels/LIQUORIX.md) is now the single kernel reference. Added a **"Validation — what we tested on real hardware"** section that consolidates the kernel-specific findings previously scattered across [DISTRO_TESTING.md](./DISTRO_TESTING.md), TODO.md, and WHAT-CHANGED-TO-THE-ISO.md. The new section carries a per-build table (the four `linux-lqx` validation builds spanning `7.0.9` → `7.0.10`) plus a checklist of what each kernel-relevant test confirmed: UEFI/systemd-boot and BIOS/syslinux boot paths, `mkarchiso` boot-image generation (`vmlinuz-linux-lqx` + `linux-lqx.preset`, stock `linux.preset` removed), `nvidia-open-dkms` DKMS compile against `linux-lqx-headers` with `driver=nonfree` boot on real NVIDIA hardware, S3 suspend / S4 hibernate-resume on bare metal, and kernel boot-phase timings. The kernel content itself was already fully promoted to production and byte-identical to the beta track; what was missing was a single place to *read* the kernel story end-to-end, evidence beside the argument.

### KERNEL_COMPARISON.md added + reconciled with LIQUORIX.md

A new four-way kernel comparison ([KERNEL_COMPARISON.md](./docs/kernels/KERNEL_COMPARISON.md) — Arch `linux` vs `linux-cachyos` vs `linux-cachyos-bore` vs Liquorix) was added and cross-checked against LIQUORIX.md. Two corrections came out of that:

- **Package identity.** The comparison described Kiro's kernel as the upstream `linux-liquorix` Debian/Ubuntu binary (repo/curl install). Kiro actually ships **`linux-lqx`** — the Chaotic-AUR build of the same patchset. Renamed `linux-liquorix` → `linux-lqx` throughout and rewrote the install-story prose to reflect the Chaotic-AUR prebuilt-binary path.
- **Stock scheduler.** The comparison correctly lists Arch stock as **EEVDF** (the mainline scheduler since 6.6); LIQUORIX.md still said **CFS**. Fixed CFS → EEVDF in LIQUORIX.md (TL;DR, scheduler study, and performance verdict) and softened the "throughput-biased" framing to "fairness-oriented."

Also added a **"A note on names"** section at the bottom of LIQUORIX.md disambiguating `linux-lqx` (Kiro's kernel) vs upstream `linux-liquorix` (Debian/Ubuntu binaries) vs `linux-kiro-lqx` (Erik's personal native-CPU build).

### DISTRO_TESTING.md — privacy scrub

Removed a personal hostname and an embedded username from the testing log (replaced with the standard `the test box` / `<user>` placeholders) per the privacy rule for published files. Test data and hardware-class details unchanged.

## 2026-05-26 — cups: airootfs trimmed to socket-only

The live ISO airootfs enabled CUPS three different ways: **`sockets.target.wants/cups.socket`**, **`printer.target.wants/cups.service`**, and **`multi-user.target.wants/cups.path`**. The service and path symlinks were redundant — socket activation alone is enough, since `cupsd` is started on demand the moment a client opens the print socket (e.g. opening printer settings or sending a job). Removed **`printer.target.wants/cups.service`** and **`multi-user.target.wants/cups.path`** (and the now-empty `printer.target.wants/` directory), leaving only **`cups.socket`** in the overlay.

**Why this matters.** These airootfs symlinks only affect the *live* session — they are not carried into the installed system, where service enablement is driven entirely by Calamares. Printing was therefore off after a fresh install + reboot. The matching fix lives in **`kiro-calamares-config`**, which now explicitly enables **`cups.socket`** (socket activation only) on the installed system. Keeping the live ISO consistent with that — socket-only everywhere — avoids confusion about why CUPS appears enabled three ways live but absent post-install.

**Files modified.**
- `archiso/airootfs/etc/systemd/system/printer.target.wants/cups.service` (removed)
- `archiso/airootfs/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/cups.path` (removed)

## 2026-05-26 — README: community framing, dropped "personal"

The README overview opened with "KIRO is a **personal** Arch Linux ISO builder" — leftover single-user framing from Kiro's early phase that contradicts the public, community-facing positioning. Reworded to lead with Kiro's identity as a **community Arch-based Linux distribution**, with this repo described as its ISO builder. Codified the rule in [Kiro-HQ/ASSISTANT.md](../../Insync/Kiro/Kiro-HQ/ASSISTANT.md) ("never call the shipped distro personal"). README only — no build artifacts affected, no rebuild needed.

## 2026-05-24 — `v26.05.24`: build/version merge, de-branding sweep, hibernate validation

A multi-theme day. Newest commits first within the day.

### Build workflow — version bump merged into the build, `change-version.sh` retired

**What changed.** The two-step release dance (`bash change-version.sh` then `bash build-the-iso.sh`) collapsed into one command. **`change-version.sh` was deleted** (128 lines) and its logic re-homed inside [build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh](./build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh) as a new `apply_version_bump()` function that runs as **Phase 2**, after the root/btrfs/chaotic preflight but before package checks. The bump is gated by a new `bump_version="yes"` flag in the config block — set it to `no` for a same-day rebuild of the currently-pinned version.

**Technical details.** `apply_version_bump()` derives `newversion="v$(date +%y.%m.%d)"` and `sed`-rewrites the three canonical version fields in place: `ISO_RELEASE=` in **dev-rel**, `kiroVersion='…'` in **build-the-iso.sh**, and both `iso_label=`/`iso_version=` in **profiledef.sh**. The `kiroVersion` substitution is anchored to `^` so it only touches the config-block assignment and never the `sed` line itself. Crucially, it then re-derives the in-memory `kiroVersion` and `isoLabel` so the *current* build uses the freshly bumped string — no stale-version mismatch between the bump and the `mkarchiso` run. A summary block echoes the three resulting lines for at-a-glance verification.

**Why.** The split was a footgun: forgetting `change-version.sh`, or running it twice, produced version drift across the three files (the exact failure mode the `## isoLabel Must Match` note in CLAUDE.md guards against). Folding it into the build as a flagged phase makes the single documented command (`cd build-scripts && bash build-the-iso.sh`) authoritative and keeps all version mutation in one place. [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) build-workflow section was rewritten to match.

### De-branding sweep — ArcoLinux / arconet → Kiro

**What changed.** A pass to scrub residual ArcoLinux ancestry from user-visible boot and shell surfaces:

- **Boot menus** — `arconet` / `arcolinux` titles replaced with `kiro` across [archiso/efiboot/loader/entries/](./archiso/efiboot/loader/entries/) (01/02/03), [archiso/grub/grub.cfg](./archiso/grub/grub.cfg), and the syslinux configs ([archiso_head.cfg](./archiso/syslinux/archiso_head.cfg), [archiso_pxe-linux.cfg](./archiso/syslinux/archiso_pxe-linux.cfg), [archiso_sys-linux.cfg](./archiso/syslinux/archiso_sys-linux.cfg)). Menu labels and help text now read "Boot kiro …" / "install kiro …".
- **GRUB distributor** — `GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR` in **archiso/airootfs/etc/default/grub** changed from `"ArcoLinux Kiro"` to `"Kiro"`.
- **Hostname** — **archiso/airootfs/etc/hostname** changed from `arconet` to `kiro`.
- **SDDM** — `Current=` in **kde_settings.conf** moved from `arcolinux-simplicity` to `edu-simplicity`.
- **skel `.bashrc`** — three dead Arco-era aliases removed: `rmlogoutlock` (pointed at `/tmp/arcologout.lock`), `install-grub-efi` (hard-coded `--bootloader-id=ArcoLinux`), and `npicom` (pointed at the non-existent `~/.config/arco-chadwm/picom/picom.conf`).

**Why.** The branding note in CLAUDE.md flags this migration as ongoing; these were the last `arco*` strings a user would actually *see* (boot screen, hostname, login theme) or trip over (broken aliases). Cosmetic, but it's the difference between a polished distro and an obvious fork.

### Live-ISO skel `.bashrc` now sourced from `edu-shells`

**What changed.** [up.sh](./up.sh) gained an `update_skel_bashrc()` step in `main()` (after `git_pull`, before `clean_pycache`) that copies `~/EDU/edu-shells/etc/skel/.bashrc-latest` over [archiso/airootfs/etc/skel/.bashrc](./archiso/airootfs/etc/skel/.bashrc). It warns and skips gracefully if the source file is absent, so the quick-push flow never breaks on a machine without the `edu-shells` checkout.

**Why.** Keeps the live-ISO skel shell config in lockstep with the canonical `edu-shells` source instead of letting the in-tree copy drift by hand-editing. See [[skel-bashrc-only]] — skel still ships only `.bashrc` (the live env is bash; the user's real shell is chosen later via ATT).

### `tuned` — `ppd_base_profile` removed

**What changed.** The `archiso/airootfs/etc/tuned/ppd_base_profile` file (added 2026-05-22 as the clobber fix) was deleted. `active_profile`, `profile_mode`, and `ppd.conf` remain.

**Caveat.** `ppd.conf` still carries the comment "Step 1 wins in practice, so `default=` only matters if `ppd_base_profile` [is wiped]" — which no longer holds now that the file is gone. With step 1 of the short-circuit chain removed, profile selection falls through to tuned's `recommend` (→ `balanced` on bare metal) before `default=performance` can fire, re-exposing the exact reset documented on 2026-05-22. **Flagged for verification** — confirm on a fresh install whether `active_profile` survives, and either restore the seed or rewrite the stale `ppd.conf` comment.

### DISTRO_TESTING — Picard bare-metal hibernate validation

**What changed.** New [DISTRO_TESTING.md](./DISTRO_TESTING.md) entry for `v26.05.24` on **Picard** (bare-metal ASUS STRIX Z270H, i7-7700K, Intel I219-V, UEFI/systemd-boot, `linux-lqx 7.0.10`). Boot PASS at 17.8s; install via Calamares with a **dedicated swap partition** (new `kiro-calamares-config-next` feature); `kiro-audit` **92 PASS / 0 WARN / 0 FAIL**. Hibernate→resume (S4) and suspend (S3) both PASS on bare metal — `resume` hook present and correctly ordered, `resume=UUID=` matches swap, swap ≥ RAM. Documented that hibernate **cannot** be validated under VirtualBox (`vmwgfx` aborts the freeze with "Can't hibernate while 3D resources are active" when VMSVGA 3D is on — a VM-GPU limitation, not a distro bug). One cosmetic finding: two boot-time `ethtool` errors from `62-network-optimization.rules` wrongly applying server-NIC knobs to the I219-V `e1000e` — fixed in `edu-system-files` `36b4f77`, pending package + ISO rebuild.

## 2026-05-23 — New Kiro logo on README

**What changed.** [README.md](./README.md) now shows the new Kiro logo, and `images/kiro.jpg` was re-exported far smaller (≈197 KB → ≈37 KB). **Why.** Updated branding asset plus a lighter repo — the old JPG was ~5× the size for no visual benefit at README display dimensions.

**Files modified.** [README.md](./README.md), `images/kiro.jpg`.

## 2026-05-22 — `tuned-ppd` clobber fix: pre-seed `ppd_base_profile`

**What changed.** Discovered that the earlier "default to `throughput-performance`" work (same day, below) didn't actually survive first boot — installed Kiro VMs were landing on `active_profile = balanced` regardless. Root cause traced through `tuned.ppd.controller.Controller.initialize()`:

```python
self._base_profile = self._load_base_profile() \
                  or self._get_recommend_profile() \
                  or self._config.default_profile
```

Short-circuit chain. `_load_base_profile()` reads `/etc/tuned/ppd_base_profile` (empty on first boot → None). `_get_recommend_profile()` asks `tuned.service` via D-Bus for its recommendation — tuned's `recommend.d` runs `virt-what` (binary not installed → error logged 4×), then falls back to its generic recommendation of `balanced`. That maps via `ppd.conf` `[profiles]` to PPD `balanced` → step 2 returns `"balanced"` → step 3 (`default=performance` in `ppd.conf`) **never fires**. The "Without this override, the airootfs-seeded active_profile is silently clobbered" comment in `ppd.conf` was correct about the symptom but wrong about the mechanism — the `default=` line itself was load-bearing for nothing.

**The fix — one new file.** Added `archiso/airootfs/etc/tuned/ppd_base_profile` containing `performance\n`. That makes step 1 of the short-circuit chain succeed, returning `"performance"`, which tuned-ppd then maps via `ppd.conf` `[profiles]` back to tuned's `throughput-performance` — exactly the airootfs-seeded `active_profile`. No more clobber.

The `tuned` package does NOT list `ppd_base_profile` in its pacman `Backup` array (only `active_profile`, `profile_mode`, etc. are), so on a `pacman -S tuned` reinstall the file would be silently overwritten with the empty package version — but Calamares does not reinstall `tuned` (only `pacman -Sy` + `systemctl enable`), so the pre-seeded file rides the airootfs squashfs unpack into the installed target intact. Verified on a fresh Kiro VM install (2026-05-22): tuned-ppd starts, reads `ppd_base_profile = performance`, maps to `throughput-performance`, writes it back to `active_profile`. Same profile, no more reset.

**Comment in `ppd.conf` rewritten.** The misleading "default=performance overrides upstream balanced" explanation replaced with an accurate description of the three-step short-circuit chain and which step actually wins. The `default=` line itself is kept as belt-and-braces — it fires only if `ppd_base_profile` is later wiped.

**Not the cause (but worth noting).** `virt-what` not being installed *produces* the four `tuned.utils.commands` errors in `/var/log/tuned/tuned.log`, but installing it wouldn't have fixed the underlying bug — on bare-metal desktops tuned still recommends `balanced` (no virt detected), short-circuiting before `default=`. The `ppd_base_profile` approach is the universal fix.

**Why this matters.** Without this, Kiro's "Performance Tuned" positioning was a lie at boot — DE power widgets showed "Balanced", CPU governor stayed on `schedutil` default, dirty page ratios used the conservative balanced profile. Now the installed system actually inherits the performance-oriented tuning the rest of the stack (Liquorix, BFQ, ananicy-cpp) is built around.

**Files modified.**
- `archiso/airootfs/etc/tuned/ppd_base_profile` (new — single line, `performance\n`)
- `archiso/airootfs/etc/tuned/ppd.conf` (comment rewritten; `default=` line unchanged)

## 2026-05-22 — `tuned` finished: add `tuned-ppd`, enable services, default to `throughput-performance`

**What changed.** The `tuned` package had been sitting in [archiso/packages.x86_64](./archiso/packages.x86_64) installed-but-dormant — no service enabled, no PPD bridge, no profile selected. Finished the job:

- **`tuned-ppd` added** to [archiso/packages.x86_64](./archiso/packages.x86_64) (line 530) — provides the `power-profiles-daemon`-compatible D-Bus interface so XFCE / KDE / GNOME power widgets can drive `tuned` without users dropping to `tuned-adm` in a terminal.
- **`tuned.service` and `tuned-ppd.service` enabled on the live ISO** via symlinks in `archiso/airootfs/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/`.
- **Default profile pinned to `throughput-performance`** via `archiso/airootfs/etc/tuned/active_profile` + `profile_mode=manual`. This is the tuned profile that maps to PPD's `performance` mode — DE power widgets will display "Performance" as the active profile on first boot. Chosen over `balanced` / `desktop` because Kiro is explicitly a performance-oriented distro (Liquorix kernel, ohmychadwm, BFQ scheduler, ananicy-cpp); the default should match that positioning rather than hedge.

**Why.** Mid-task audit caught the half-baked state — `tuned` was listed but not wired up, contradicting the README's "Performance Tuned" claim. Without `tuned-ppd`, no DE power widget could see profiles; without a service symlink, the daemon never ran. The CHANGELOG history shows `tuned` was added → removed → re-added over time without a clean finish; this commit closes that loop.

**Follow-up (not in this repo).** The installed system enables services via Calamares, not this overlay. `kiro-calamares-config` and/or `kiro_final` need a matching `systemctl enable tuned.service tuned-ppd.service` so the post-install system inherits the same setup — flagged for the next session.

**Files modified.**
- [archiso/packages.x86_64](./archiso/packages.x86_64)
- `archiso/airootfs/etc/tuned/active_profile` (new)

## 2026-05-21 — Add WHAT-CHANGED-TO-THE-ISO.md (rolling release log)

**What changed.** New top-level doc [WHAT-CHANGED-TO-THE-ISO.md](./docs/WHAT-CHANGED-TO-THE-ISO.md) added — a rolling, user-facing release log that explains what's actually different between Kiro ISO builds (kernel, audio stack, defaults, calamares, security baseline, tooling). Updated monthly or per significant release; new entries land at the top. First entry covers the 2026-05-17 → 2026-05-21 release window: Liquorix kernel default, PipeWire migration, new `kiro-*` diagnostic toolchain in `edu-system-files`, security hardening pass (live-ISO SSH lockdown, CUPS 0600, sysctl tightening, PAM, udev, BFQ), installer mkinitcpio HOOKS fix + resume hook, version-scheme cleanup, edu-chadwm drop.

**Why.** Users browsing the repo had no single place to see "what's new in this release" — the CHANGELOG is implementation-focused and not pitched at end users, and the per-feature docs (LIQUORIX.md, PIPEWIRE-MIGRATION.md, KIRO-VS-PRISM.md) each cover one thing in depth. The new doc is the elevator-pitch level, with links down into the deep dives. Designed to be the script source for monthly video walkthroughs as well.

**Files modified.**
- [WHAT-CHANGED-TO-THE-ISO.md](./docs/WHAT-CHANGED-TO-THE-ISO.md) (new)

## 2026-05-21 — User-facing LIQUORIX.md rewrite

**What changed.** [LIQUORIX.md](./docs/kernels/LIQUORIX.md) rewritten from a pre-decision "should we switch?" study into a user-facing "why we ship Liquorix" doc. New structure: TL;DR comparison table; what-you'll-feel summary; eight study sections (scheduler, HZ, preemption, memory/IO, security parity, modules, DKMS, update cadence); performance verdict; honest trade-offs (Chaotic-AUR supply chain, no LTS variant); five-file change-set table for forkers; looking-ahead notes (NVIDIA hygiene, LTS fallback, rEFInd, `linux-kiro-lqx` separation).

**Why.** The doc was written before the kernel switch landed. By the time `linux-lqx` was actually shipping in `archiso/packages.x86_64`, `efiboot/loader/entries/*.conf`, `syslinux/*.cfg`, and `kiro-calamares-config/.../unpackfs2.conf`, the doc still asked an already-answered question. Reframing it to "we shipped this, here's the reasoning" makes it useful to readers (potential Kiro users, forkers, anyone evaluating distros) instead of just to past-Erik.

## 2026-05-19 — Deep source-vs-VM verification + duplicate config cleanup

### Source-to-VM integrity check

A full deep comparison was run between the airootfs overlay (kiro-iso), the edu-system-files package overlay, and the actual installed state on the Kiro VirtualBox VM (v26.05.19). Every file in both overlays was traced to its destination on the installed system and verified.

**kiro-audit result: 93 PASS / 0 WARN / 0 FAIL** — the cleanest audit result to date. All checks from the morning security session are confirmed active on the running system.

**Clarification — `10-archiso.conf` is intentional in source.** The file `archiso/airootfs/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/10-archiso.conf` must remain in the source tree because archiso only creates a directory on the live ISO if at least one file lands in it. Removing the file causes `sshd_config.d/` to be absent, which produces errors. The live ISO needs the override for remote access during the install session; `kiro_final` removes the file from the installed system. Confirmed absent on the VM post-install.

**`do-not-suspend.conf` confirmed intentional.** `archiso/airootfs/etc/systemd/logind.conf.d/do-not-suspend.conf` (disables suspend/hibernate/lid-close) survives to the installed system. This is correct behaviour for a desktop distro — no laptop lid-close events apply.

### Fix — Remove duplicate `memory-accounting.conf` from airootfs

`archiso/airootfs/etc/systemd/system.conf.d/memory-accounting.conf` was a leftover from before `edu-system-files` took over memory accounting configuration. The edu-system-files package already ships `90-memory-accounting.conf` with `DefaultMemoryAccounting=true`. The airootfs copy duplicated this and also set `DefaultSwapAccounting=true`, which is deprecated in modern systemd and produced a warning in the journal on every boot:

```
Unknown key 'DefaultSwapAccounting' in section [Manager], ignoring.
```

The airootfs file was deleted. The edu-system-files package version is now the sole source of truth.

### Claude Code commands added

Two new Claude Code slash commands were created in `~/.claude/commands/` to formalize the release and verification workflows:

- **`/kiro-ready`** — GO/NO-GO release check: verifies git state of all 5 source repos (kiro-iso, kiro-iso-next, kiro-calamares-config, kiro-calamares-config-next, edu-system-files), reads TODO.md for blockers, reads DISTRO_TESTING.md for the last test result, SSHes into the Kiro VirtualBox to run kiro-audit, and checks ISO build recency. Renders a verdict table.
- **`/kiro-check`** — Deep source-vs-VM comparison: checks every security-sensitive file, detects live-environment survivors, finds journal warnings from deprecated config, verifies sysctl values, udev rules, script inventory, and catches git re-add accidents (files deleted and silently re-added by `up.sh`).

**Files Modified:** `archiso/airootfs/etc/systemd/system.conf.d/memory-accounting.conf` (deleted), `~/.claude/commands/kiro-ready.md` (new), `~/.claude/commands/kiro-check.md` (new)

---

## 2026-05-19 — Security audit: Arch vs Kiro comparison + fixes

### SSH tooling for VirtualBox VMs

Two new scripts were written in `~/DATA/arcolinux-nemesis/scripts/`:

- **`ssh-into-kiro-vb.sh`** — fully automated SSH setup for the Kiro VirtualBox VM. The script detects VM state and uses `VBoxManage modifyvm --natpf1` (VM off) or `VBoxManage controlvm natpf1` (VM running) to set up NAT port forwarding idempotently, clears stale `known_hosts` entries, checks for `sshpass`, and connects. On first-attempt failure it prints a guest-setup guide (openssh + sshd + user creation) and retries. Port `2022`.
- **`ssh-into-arch-vb.sh`** — identical structure for a virgin Arch VM used as a comparison baseline. Port `2023`.

Both follow the standard bash template (colors, log functions, error trap, main). A grep bug in the original script was fixed: `rule_exists()` was matching `"ssh-kiro"` (name + closing quote) but VBoxManage's machinereadable format is `"ssh-kiro,tcp,...` (name + comma), causing false "rule missing" errors even when the rule was present.

### Security comparison: Arch vs Kiro

A full 10-phase security and permissions audit was run across both live VMs via SSH. Results written to **`ARCH-VS-KIRO-SECURITY.md`**. Phases covered: users/groups/sudo, SUID/SGID binaries, world-writable files, SSH config, listening ports and firewall, enabled systemd units, key `/etc` files and sysctl, package delta, `/etc` directory permissions, and home/root directories.

**Key finding — Kiro is substantially more hardened than vanilla Arch at the kernel level.** The `99-kiro-optimizations.conf` sysctl profile tightens `kptr_restrict`, `dmesg_restrict`, `ptrace_scope`, `unprivileged_bpf_disabled`, `perf_event_paranoid`, `suid_dumpable`, `sysrq`, and `send_redirects` — all set to safer values than Arch defaults. No unexpected SUID binaries, no world-writable surprises.

Three issues were identified and resolved:

### Fix 1 — Remove archiso SSH override (`PermitRootLogin yes`)

`archiso/airootfs/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/10-archiso.conf` was shipping with the ISO and surviving into installed systems. It explicitly set `PermitRootLogin yes` and `PasswordAuthentication yes` — intended for the archiso build environment, not for user machines. Neither Kiro's live environment nor its install workflow requires root SSH with password. The file was deleted; OpenSSH's safe default (`prohibit-password`) now applies everywhere. Password login for the user account is unaffected (default sshd behaviour allows it).

### Fix 2 — CUPS config file permissions

`/etc/cups/classes.conf` and `/etc/cups/printers.conf` were world-readable (`644`) on Kiro, compared to `600 root:cups` on a vanilla Arch install. These files can contain printer device URIs and credentials. A `tmpfiles.d` rule was added at `archiso/airootfs/etc/tmpfiles.d/cups-permissions.conf` using the `z` directive to enforce `600 root:cups` on both files at every boot via `systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service`.

### kiro-audit expanded (edu-system-files-git)

`audit.sh` was removed from both `kiro-iso` and `kiro-iso-next` — it was a stale copy superseded by `kiro-audit` in `edu-system-files-git` (which ships to every installed Kiro system at `/usr/local/bin/kiro-audit`). The edu-system-files version was already 40 lines ahead with `--help`, `--version`, and a root check.

`kiro-audit` was then expanded significantly with checks that reflect this session's security work and general system health:

- **`check_sysctl_security()`** — verifies all 8 hardening values from `99-kiro-optimizations.conf` are live on the running system: `kptr_restrict`, `dmesg_restrict`, `ptrace_scope`, `unprivileged_bpf_disabled`, `perf_event_paranoid`, `suid_dumpable`, `send_redirects`, `tcp_syncookies`. Catches any regression where the sysctl file exists but values aren't applied.
- **`check_zram()`** — verifies `zram-generator` is installed, config is present, `/dev/zram0` is active as swap, and compression is `zstd`.
- **`check_failed_units()`** — fails if any systemd units are in failed state.
- **`check_boot_and_updates()`** — INFO-only: prints boot time (`systemd-analyze`) and pending update count. No PASS/FAIL threshold.
- **`check_permissions()` expanded** — now also checks that `10-archiso.conf` SSH override is absent, `tmpfiles.d/cups-permissions.conf` is present, and CUPS config files are `600` if they exist.
- **MAKEFLAGS CPU check** — replaced the basic `-j exists` check with a `nproc` comparison: PASS if MAKEFLAGS `-j` matches actual CPU count, WARN if fewer, FAIL if missing.

The audit was run on the test box (real metal, `<ip>:<port>`) and produced 79 PASS / 0 WARN / 4 FAIL — the 4 FAILs are all expected pre-fix issues from the test box's older ISO install (archiso SSH override, missing tmpfiles.d, CUPS permissions). All new checks behaved correctly on real hardware.

### Real metal SSH script

`ssh-into-testbox.sh` added to `~/DATA/arcolinux-nemesis/scripts/`. Simpler than the VirtualBox scripts — no NAT forwarding needed, just a reachability ping check before connecting with `sshpass`. Host `<ip>`, port `<port>`, user `<user>`.

### Security fixes synced to kiro-iso-next

All three security fixes (SSH override removal, CUPS tmpfiles.d, ARCH-VS-KIRO-SECURITY.md) were applied to `kiro-iso-next` as well — both production and beta repos are now in sync.

### Fix 3 — rlogin/rsh (inetutils) — accepted as-is

`inetutils` ships `rlogin`/`rsh` PAM configs as a side effect of providing `ifconfig`, which Kiro needs. No systemd units for those legacy daemons are enabled; no daemon is running. Risk is theoretical only — accepted.

**Files Modified:** `archiso/airootfs/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/10-archiso.conf` (deleted), `archiso/airootfs/etc/tmpfiles.d/cups-permissions.conf` (new), `ARCH-VS-KIRO-SECURITY.md` (new)

---

## 2026-05-18 — TODO housekeeping

Short session. No code changed — this was a pure status-tracking pass after earlier build and boot testing.

**BIOS/syslinux boot path verified.** The syslinux configs had been updated for `linux-lqx` in a previous session but only UEFI (GRUB + systemd-boot in VirtualBox) had been confirmed working. BIOS boot was tested and confirmed good. Moved from Backlog to Done.

**PipeWire status confirmed.** The PipeWire stack was marked "Needs build + audio test" — now confirmed verified working.

**Remaining open item:** NVIDIA `driver=nonfree` boot + DKMS compile against `linux-lqx-headers` on real NVIDIA hardware. Only remaining Backlog item.

**Files Modified:** `TODO.md`

---

## 2026-05-18 — `v26.05.18.01`

### ISO audit: VirtualBox installed-system verification + audit.sh

**Build script fix — `isoLabel` missing `next`.** The checksum phase at the end of `build-the-iso.sh` was constructing `isoLabel="kiro-${kiroVersion}-x86_64.iso"` but `mkarchiso` produces filenames from `iso_name` in `profiledef.sh`, which is `kiro-next`. The mismatch caused sha1sum/sha256sum/md5sum to fail with "No such file or directory" on every build. Fixed to `isoLabel="kiro-next-${kiroVersion}-x86_64.iso"`.

**`audit.sh` — installed system health checker.** A comprehensive `audit.sh` script was written and committed to the repo root (also synced to `edu-system-files/usr/local/bin/`). It SSHes into or runs locally on an installed Kiro system and checks 63+ conditions across: kernel (`linux-lqx`), microcode (correct vendor, wrong one removed), mkinitcpio hooks (no archiso hook, microcode/kms present), audio stack (PipeWire complete, pulseaudio absent), all 4 Calamares module results (`kiro_before`, `kiro_final`, `kiro_remove_nvidia`, `kiro_ucode`), pacman repos, desktop session files, SDDM theme, user groups, systemd services, key file permissions, NVIDIA handling, bootloader, and `pacman -Qk` package integrity. Results are grouped as PASS / WARN / FAIL with a summary count. Designed to be extended month-by-month.

**VirtualBox audit findings (v26.05.18.01, UEFI, Intel VirtualBox):**
- 63 PASS — all core functionality verified working
- 1 WARN — `/etc/calamares/` config dir left on system (explained by the FAIL below)
- 1 FAIL — `kiro-calamares-config-next` still installed; `kiro_final`'s final removal step ran `pacman -R --noconfirm kiro-calamares-config-next` inside a `try/except` that swallows the failure — the package has no dependencies and is manually removable, but the silent failure means it wasn't cleaned up at install time
- Firmware warnings during build (`softing_cs`, `lantiq_gswip`, `adf7242`) are benign — ultra-niche hardware with no firmware in any Arch package; harmless and unfixable without blacklisting modules
- `pacman -Qk` exceptions: `ohmychadwm-git` (makepkg cleans build artifacts), `bind`/`cups`/`nfs-utils` (config files created only when services are first used) — all whitelisted in audit.sh

**Files Modified:** `build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh`, `audit.sh` (new)

---

### edu-chadwm dropped; README accuracy overhaul

**`edu-chadwm` removed going forward.** The package `edu-chadwm-git` was already commented out in `archiso/packages.x86_64`, but references to it persisted in `build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh` (the `desktop` label variable), `CLAUDE.md`, and `README.md`. All forward-facing references have been cleaned up. CHANGELOG historical entries were left intact — they accurately describe what the ISO shipped at the time.

**README rewritten for accuracy.** A full audit revealed several stale or incorrect entries:

- `enable-oomd.sh` and `disable-oomd.sh` were referenced in the project tree and Key Scripts section but do not exist in the repo — removed
- `personal_repo/` was listed as a root-level directory — it does not exist; the relevant comment is in `archiso/pacman.conf` — removed
- `packages.bootstrap` was listed with the wrong name; the actual file is `bootstrap_packages` — corrected
- `setup.sh`, `change-version.sh`, `up.sh`, and `CHANGELOG.md` were missing from the project tree — added
- The Building KIRO section omitted the required first step (`change-version.sh`) and made no mention of the NVIDIA driver selection knob — both added
- "Based on the ArcoLinux project" in the Overview — ArcoLinux branding reference removed
- The stale "Recent Changes" section (listing Calamares migrations from months ago) replaced with a link to `CHANGELOG.md`
- ArcoLinux tutorial link removed from Resources
- `✅` emoji bullets and the `🖖` sign-off removed throughout

**Files Modified:** `build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`

---

### Build script standardization — full template conformance pass

All four build scripts were audited against the project standard template (modelled on `up.sh`) and brought into full conformance. This was a correctness and maintainability pass, not cosmetic cleanup — several of the changes fix real failure modes that were silently swallowed before.

#### `build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh`

The most significant rewrite. The old script had `set -e` only, meaning unset variable references and failed pipe segments would silently continue and corrupt the build in hard-to-diagnose ways. It also had no error trap, so a failing phase gave no indication of *where* it failed.

The new version adds `set -euo pipefail` and the standard `on_error` trap that prints the failing line number and command. Beyond that:

- **`SCRIPT_DIR` / `REPO_DIR`** replace the hand-rolled `installed_dir="$(dirname)/.."` pattern. All file paths are now anchored to the script's location, so the build works correctly regardless of which directory you call it from.
- **`check_not_root()`** hard-aborts if run as root. The old version only printed a warning and continued — a user who missed the message would proceed to build as root, which `mkarchiso` handles poorly.
- **`wget` failure guard** — the old code fetched `.bashrc` from edu-shells with no failure check. If the download failed (network blip, GitHub down), the build would continue with whatever stale content was in skel. Now a failed download aborts with a clear error.
- **Safe skel cleanup** — `rm -rf skel/.*` was replaced with `find -mindepth 1 -delete`. The `.*` glob can expand to include `.` or `..` on some systems, which would be catastrophic.
- **Config block at the top** — `nvidia_driver`, `clean_pacman_cache`, and `remove_build_folder` are now gathered at the top of the file before any functions. Previously these knobs were scattered through 490 lines; now they're the first thing you see when you open the file.
- **Named phase functions** — each build phase is now a function (`prepare_build_tree`, `prepopulate_keyring`, `inject_nvidia_packages`, etc.) called from `main()`. This makes the high-level flow immediately readable and allows individual phases to be tested in isolation.
- **Removed dead code** — `archisoRequiredVersion="archiso 84-1"` was declared but never checked anywhere in the script. Removed.
- **TTY-safe colors** — raw `tput setaf` calls had no `[[ -t 1 ]]` guard. If the script was ever piped or redirected, the escape codes would corrupt the output. The new colors block falls back to empty strings when stdout is not a terminal.
- **Startup `sleep` calls removed** — there were `sleep 2` and `sleep 3` calls at startup that served no purpose. The BTRFS countdown (10 seconds with CTRL+C prompt) was intentionally kept — that one gives the user a real chance to abort.
- **Phase numbering fixed** — the old script had phases 1, 2, 3, 4, 4b, 5, 7, 8, 9 (Phase 6 missing entirely, 4b awkward). Phases are now sequential 1–9.

#### `change-version.sh`

Added `set -euo pipefail`, the standard header, `SCRIPT_DIR`, TTY-safe colors, log functions, and `on_error` trap. Previously, if any `sed` call silently failed (e.g. a regex didn't match because a file format changed), the version bump would partially update some files and leave others stale — and the script would exit 0. Now any failure aborts immediately and reports the line. All paths anchored to `SCRIPT_DIR` so the script works from any working directory. Dead commented-out debug lines removed. Logic wrapped in `bump_version()` inside `main()`.

#### `build-scripts/get-pacman-repos-keys-and-mirrors.sh`

**Critical fix:** the `pacman.conf` copy used `new_conf="pacman.conf"` — a bare filename resolved against `$PWD`. If `build-the-iso.sh` called this script (which it does, via `bash "$SCRIPT_DIR/get-pacman-repos-keys-and-mirrors.sh"`), the working directory at call time is the repo root, not `build-scripts/`. The copy would fail or source the wrong file. Fixed to `"${SCRIPT_DIR}/pacman.conf"`. Also brought into full template conformance with standard header, colors, log functions, and `on_error` trap.

#### `build-scripts/install-yay-or-paru.sh`

The yay and paru install branches were identical except for the package name and URL — a straight copy-paste. Collapsed into a single `install_aur_helper name url` function. Added `/tmp` cleanup after `makepkg` (the original left the tarball and source directory behind). Full template conformance.

#### `archiso/airootfs/etc/dev-rel`

`ISO_CODENAME` was still set to `arconet - kiro` — a leftover ArcoLinux branding reference. Changed to `kiro`.

**Files Modified:** `build-scripts/build-the-iso.sh`, `build-scripts/get-pacman-repos-keys-and-mirrors.sh`, `build-scripts/install-yay-or-paru.sh`, `change-version.sh`, `archiso/airootfs/etc/dev-rel`, `TODO.md` (created stub)

---

## 2026-05-01 — `v26.05.01.01`
- **Version bump** + mirrorlist refresh

## 2026-04-30 — `v26.04.30.01`

- **Version bump** + mirrorlist refresh — removed one stale mirror entry to keep the list clean and reduce the chance of hitting a dead server on first boot

## 2026-04-29 — `v26.04.29.01`
- **Version bump** + mirrorlist refresh

---

## 2026-04-28 — `v26.04.28.01`

### `up.sh` — maintenance improvements

Two new lines were added to **`up.sh`**, the daily ISO maintenance helper script. This script is what drives the version bump + mirrorlist cycle that keeps every ISO build fresh and reproducible.

---

## 2026-04-26 — `v26.04.26.01`

### Script renamed: `setup-git-v5.sh` → `setup.sh`

The developer environment bootstrap script was renamed from **`setup-git-v5.sh`** to the simpler **`setup.sh`**. The old name carried an explicit version number in the filename, which is an anti-pattern — the version is already tracked by git. The new name is cleaner, easier to type, and makes it obvious what the script does without implying it is just one in a long series of sequential versions.

### Mirrorlist cleanup

Two mirror entries were removed from the embedded mirrorlist. Stale or unreliable mirrors slow down the first `pacman -Syu` run on a freshly booted live system, so keeping the list curated is worth the small maintenance cost.

---

## 2026-04-25 — `v26.04.25.01`

### Package added: `capitaine-cursors`

**`capitaine-cursors`** is a clean, modern X11 cursor theme inspired by macOS. Adding it to the ISO ensures that every desktop environment — XFCE4, ohmychadwm, and edu-chadwm — ships with a polished, HiDPI-aware cursor out of the box, rather than falling back to the default X11 arrow. This is a small quality-of-life detail that significantly improves the first-impression polish of the live session.

---

## 2026-04-20 — `v26.04.20.01`

### Enabled `systemd-resolved` as a DNS resolver

Four systemd symlinks were added to enable **`systemd-resolved`** at boot:

- `dbus-org.freedesktop.resolve1.service` — exposes the resolver on D-Bus so applications can query it via the standard API
- `systemd-resolved-monitor.socket` — allows runtime monitoring of DNS state
- `systemd-resolved-varlink.socket` — the modern varlink IPC socket used by newer tools
- `systemd-resolved.service` (under `sysinit.target.wants`) — starts the resolver early in boot

**Why this matters:** `systemd-resolved` is the recommended DNS resolver for systemd-based systems. It provides automatic mDNS (Avahi-style local hostname resolution), DNSSEC validation, DNS-over-TLS support, and proper integration with VPNs and per-interface DNS settings. Without it enabled, the live system falls back to basic `/etc/resolv.conf` parsing, which can cause subtle failures on networks with mDNS hostnames or split-horizon DNS. This change pairs with the `nsswitch.conf` update made on 2026-03-22 (which set the host resolution order to `files mymachines mdns_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] resolve dns wins myhostname`) to create a fully modern DNS stack that works reliably on home networks, office environments, and bare-metal servers alike.

---

## 2026-04-19 — `v26.04.19.01`

### New packages: `edu-powermenu-git`, `edu-system-files-git`, `cpuid`

- **`edu-powermenu-git`** — adds the KIRO/edu branded power menu (shutdown, reboot, suspend, lock) that integrates consistently with all three desktop environments. Previously users had to reach into a terminal or use desktop-specific logout dialogs; this gives a single consistent entry point regardless of which WM is active.

- **`edu-system-files-git`** — pulls in the curated set of system configuration files maintained in the edu ecosystem. These cover sensible defaults for things like font rendering, GTK theming, locale settings, and input handling. Shipping them through a package (rather than baking raw config files into the ISO airootfs) means they can be updated independently via `pacman -Syu` without requiring a full ISO rebuild.

- **`cpuid`** — a command-line tool that decodes the CPU identification registers and reports detailed processor information (family, model, features, cache topology). Useful for hardware debugging, virtualization compatibility checks, and verifying that CPU feature flags needed for specific workloads are actually present. Particularly valuable on a live ISO where users may be running it on unfamiliar hardware.

### Desktop label updated

The ISO desktop label in **`build-the-iso.sh`** was updated from `xfce4/chadwm` to `xfce4/edu-chadwm/ohmychadwm`. This accurately reflects the three desktop environments that ship in the ISO and makes it immediately clear to anyone reading the build output (or examining the ISO metadata) what they are getting.

## 2026-04-17 — Mirror URL fix in `get-pacman-repos-keys-and-mirrors.sh`

The Chaotic-AUR mirror URL inside the installation script was updated to point to the current active endpoint. Mirror URLs for Chaotic-AUR have changed over the project's lifetime as the infrastructure evolved; using a stale URL causes the Chaotic-AUR key import and repository setup to fail silently or with a confusing error, which blocks the entire installation workflow for users who want AUR packages. Keeping this URL current is maintenance work that directly affects the user's first-boot experience.

---

## 2026-04-16 — OOMD, Shell Debranding, and Documentation Day

This was a dense day of work with multiple distinct themes. Seven commits landed.

### systemd Out-of-Memory Daemon (OOMD) — fully integrated

The live ISO now ships with **`systemd-oomd`** enabled and configured. OOMD is systemd's built-in out-of-memory killer, and unlike the kernel's OOM killer — which is a last resort that can freeze a system for tens of seconds before acting — OOMD monitors memory pressure proactively at the cgroup level and kills the heaviest-consuming processes before the system becomes completely unresponsive.

The following was added:

- **`archiso/airootfs/etc/systemd/oomd.conf`** — global OOMD configuration tuned for desktop workloads: swap usage threshold and memory pressure thresholds set to intervene before the system locks up
- **`system.slice.d/oomd.conf`** — applies OOMD monitoring to all system-level services, so a runaway daemon doesn't take the entire system down
- **`user.slice.d/oomd.conf`** — applies OOMD monitoring to the user session, so a memory-hungry browser or desktop app triggers a clean kill rather than a kernel panic cascade
- **`system.conf.d/memory-accounting.conf`** — enables per-cgroup memory accounting, which is a prerequisite for OOMD to work; without this, OOMD cannot observe per-process memory usage

The service and socket symlinks (`dbus-org.freedesktop.oom1.service`, `systemd-oomd.service`, `systemd-oomd.socket`) were added to ensure OOMD starts automatically on boot.

During the day, both an `enable-oomd.sh` and `disable-oomd.sh` helper script were created and then removed. The initial plan was to provide opt-in scripts for post-install systems, but the right approach turned out to be integrating OOMD directly into the ISO configuration so every boot has it active without any user intervention. The scripts were folded into the static config and deleted.

### `.bashrc` — ArcoLinux debranding and shell hygiene

The default **`/etc/skel/.bashrc`** that every new user inherits received a significant cleanup pass, completing the transition away from the ArcoLinux branding that was present in the original base.

**What was removed:**

- `alias toboot`, `togrub`, `torefind` — these called `arcolinux-toboot`, `arcolinux-togrub`, `arcolinux-torefind`, scripts that do not exist in a KIRO system
- `alias vbm` — called `arcolinux-vbox-share`, an ArcoLinux-specific VirtualBox helper
- `alias rvariety`, `rkmix`, `rconky` — called ArcoLinux removal scripts; replaced `rvariety` with the edu equivalent `edu-remove-variety`
- `alias whichvga` — updated from `arcolinux-which-vga` to `edu-which-vga`
- `alias narcomirrorlist` — replaced with `alias nchaoticmirrorlist` pointing to the Chaotic-AUR mirrorlist, which is actually present on the system
- `alias iso`, `isoo` — these printed ArcoLinux version info; removed entirely since the KIRO version is in `/etc/dev-rel`
- `alias vbm` — ArcoLinux VirtualBox mounting helper, not applicable

**What was added:**

- `alias u="sudo pacman -Syu"` — a short, memorable shortcut for the most common maintenance operation
- `alias neo="neofetch"` — quick system info display
- `alias npicom="$EDITOR ~/.config/arco-chadwm/picom/picom.conf"` — quick editor access to the picom compositor config, useful for chadwm users tuning their compositor
- `alias nchaoticmirrorlist="sudo $EDITOR /etc/pacman.d/chaotic-mirrorlist"` — quick access to edit the Chaotic-AUR mirrorlist
- `### EDU-SHELLS` section header — organizes the file to match the structure used in the edu-shells package

**PATH deduplication fix:**

The old `~/.bashrc` used naive `PATH="$HOME/.bin:$PATH"` assignments to add local directories to `PATH`. If `.bashrc` is sourced more than once (which happens in nested shells, tmux, and some login scenarios), these assignments duplicate the same directory in `PATH` repeatedly. The fix uses the standard `case ":$PATH:" in *":$dir:"*` guard pattern, which is a well-known shell idiom that only appends the directory if it is not already present. This prevents PATH from ballooning with repeated entries and avoids subtle issues where the wrong version of a tool might be picked up due to a duplicated and reordered PATH.

### Documentation — `OVERVIEW.md` added, `README.md` expanded

A new **`OVERVIEW.md`** file was added (214 lines) with a complete structural breakdown of the repository: what each directory contains, how the build system works, which services are enabled by default, and how the three desktop environments relate to each other. This is intended as a quick-start reference for anyone contributing to the project or trying to understand the ISO without having to read every config file individually.

**`README.md`** was nearly tripled in size (from ~90 lines to ~370 lines), adding detailed sections on:

- Prerequisites and build steps
- What each package category includes and why
- How to customize the package list
- Service topology (which services are enabled and what they do)

### Screenshots reorganized into `images/`

The four screenshot images (`kiro-chadwm.jpg`, `kiro-ohmychadwm.jpg`, `kiro-xfce.jpg`, `kiro.jpg`) were moved from the repository root into a dedicated **`images/`** subfolder, and the `README.md` image references were updated accordingly. This is a housekeeping change that keeps the root of the repository clean — a flat root directory with a mix of scripts, configs, and image files makes it hard to quickly find what you are looking for.

---

## 2026-04-15 — PCI Latency, Optimization Config Separation

### System optimization configs moved to `edu-dot-files`

Several systemd drop-in config files that were previously baked directly into the ISO airootfs were removed:

- `systemd/journald.conf.d/volatile-storage.conf`
- `systemd/system.conf.d/10-parallel-services.conf` (at this point)

These configs are now delivered by the **`edu-dot-files-git`** package instead. This is an important architectural decision: configs that live inside the ISO can only be updated by rebuilding and redistributing the ISO, which is a multi-hundred-megabyte operation. Configs delivered by a package can be updated with a simple `pacman -Syu`. Moving non-ISO-critical configuration out of the airootfs and into the dotfiles package reduces the ISO size slightly and means users always get the latest tuning without waiting for a new ISO release.

### PCI Latency optimization — added and removed in the same day

A **`pci-latency`** script was added (`/usr/local/bin/pci-latency`, 56 lines) along with a `pci-latency.service` systemd unit that runs it at boot. The script reads each PCI device's latency timer register and sets it to an optimal value, which can reduce audio crackling under load and improve I/O responsiveness, particularly on older hardware and systems with multiple PCI peripherals competing for bus time.

Later the same day, the script and service were removed from the ISO. The decision was made to keep PCI latency tuning in the external dotfiles (`edu-dot-files`) rather than the ISO configuration, for the same reason as above: it is a user-facing optimization rather than something required for the live session to function. Users who want it can install the dotfiles package. This keeps the ISO lean and focused on boot-critical configuration only.

### `ananicy-cpp.service` enabled

**Ananicy-cpp** (Another Auto NICe daemon, C++ rewrite) is a process scheduler that automatically adjusts process priorities and I/O scheduling classes based on a curated rules database. Enabling it at boot via a symlink means the live session immediately benefits from better CPU scheduling: interactive applications like browsers and terminals get higher priority, build tools and background processes get lower priority, and the system feels more responsive under mixed workloads. This pairs with `cachyos-ananicy-rules-git` (already in the package list) which provides the extensive rules database.

### `profile.d/userbin.sh` — `~/.local/bin` in PATH at login

A small `profile.d` script was added to ensure `~/.local/bin` is present in `PATH` for all login sessions. This is where pip, pipx, cargo, and other language-specific installers place user-owned executables. Without this, tools installed to `~/.local/bin` are invisible to the shell unless the user manually adds the path, which is a common source of confusion on Arch-based systems where the default shell config is minimal.

---

## 2026-04-14 — Power Management Iteration, Nanorc, Boot Config

This day involved several commits that explored and then refined the power management configuration.

### Power management tuning

The power management stack was iterated through several states:

1. **`tlp` removed, `tuned` added** — TLP (Laptop Power Saving) was replaced by `tuned`, a daemon from Red Hat/Fedora that uses profiles to tune system performance vs. power tradeoffs. Unlike TLP, which is focused primarily on laptops and batteries, `tuned` works equally well on desktops and servers, making it a better fit for a general-purpose ISO. `upower` was added at the same time — it provides a D-Bus API for battery and power state that desktop environments use to show charge level and trigger suspend.

2. **CPU governor config added** — `cpupower` was added with a config file (`/etc/default/cpupower`) setting `governor='performance'`, which keeps the CPU at maximum frequency. For a live ISO used for testing and installation, maximum performance is generally preferable over power saving.

3. **`cpupower` and `tuned` removed** — After testing, both were removed from the package list. The conclusion was that for a live ISO session, the kernel's default scheduler and governor behavior is sufficient, and adding power management daemons introduces complexity without clear benefit in a short-lived session. `alsa-utils` was also removed (ALSA is handled via the higher-level PipeWire/PulseAudio stack already present). `ntp` was removed in favor of `systemd-timesyncd` which is already part of systemd.

### `archlinux-tweak-tool` upgraded to GTK4

The **`archlinux-tweak-tool-git`** package was replaced with **`archlinux-tweak-tool-gtk4-git`**. The GTK4 version is the actively maintained branch; the GTK3 version is legacy. This ensures the tweak tool works correctly under modern GTK theme configurations and is compatible with the libadwaita-based theming that newer GTK4 applications use.

### `10-parallel-services.conf` — systemd timeout tuning

A new drop-in config at `system.conf.d/10-parallel-services.conf` was added with two settings:

```ini
[Manager]
DefaultTimeoutStopSec=10s
DefaultTimeoutAbortSec=5s
```

The default `DefaultTimeoutStopSec` is 90 seconds — meaning systemd will wait up to 90 seconds for a service to stop before killing it. On a live ISO, this makes shutdown feel extremely slow if any service hangs. Reducing it to 10 seconds means a clean shutdown completes in well under 30 seconds total even with misbehaving services. `DefaultTimeoutAbortSec=5s` similarly limits the time given to services that are force-killed before systemd gives up entirely.

### `nanorc` — syntax highlighting for the default editor

A comprehensive **`nanorc`** configuration file (349 lines) was added to the ISO's `/etc/nanorc`. The default nano on Arch Linux ships with minimal syntax highlighting; this config enables color-coded syntax for: shell scripts, Python, C/C++, Makefiles, INI files, systemd unit files, pacman config files, and several other formats. Since `nano` is the default editor in the ISO (set in `.bashrc`), this means users editing config files during installation get a readable, color-coded experience rather than plain monochrome text.

---

## 2026-03-27 — systemd-networkd: Type-Based Interface Matching

The network configuration files in `archiso/airootfs/etc/systemd/network/` were updated to use type-based interface matching instead of name-based glob matching:

**Before:**

- `20-ethernet.network`: matched `Name=en*` and `Name=eth*`
- `20-wlan.network`: matched `Name=wl*`
- `20-wwan.network`: matched `Name=ww*`

**After:**

- `20-ethernet.network`: matches `Type=ether` with `Kind=!*` to exclude virtual interfaces
- `20-wlan.network`: matches `Type=wlan`
- `20-wwan.network`: matches `Type=wwan`

**Why this matters:** Predictable Network Interface Names (the `en*`/`wl*` prefix convention) are not guaranteed. On some systems, particularly with USB ethernet adapters, VM guests, or exotic hardware, interface names may not follow the `en`/`wl` convention. By matching on `Type=` instead of `Name=`, the network configuration works correctly on any hardware regardless of what the kernel chose to name the interface. The `Kind=!*` filter on the ethernet rule excludes virtual ethernet interfaces (veth, bridge members, etc.) which should not be managed by the live session's network config — this was an existing issue noted in the previous config via a comment referencing Arch bug #70892.

---

## 2026-03-22 — `nsswitch.conf` — Host Resolution Order Fixed

The Name Service Switch configuration (`/etc/nsswitch.conf`) was updated to change the `hosts:` line:

**Before:** `hosts: mymachines resolve [!UNAVAIL=return] files dns mdns wins myhostname`

**After:** `hosts: files mymachines mdns_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] resolve dns wins myhostname`

**Why this matters:** The original order put `resolve` (systemd-resolved) before `files`, meaning `/etc/hosts` was not consulted first. This caused two problems: (1) local hostname overrides in `/etc/hosts` were ignored, which is unexpected behavior; (2) on systems where `systemd-resolved` is not yet started, host lookups could time out instead of falling back gracefully. The new order matches the recommended Arch Linux configuration: `files` first (so `/etc/hosts` always wins), then `mymachines` (for systemd container hostnames), then `mdns_minimal` with `[NOTFOUND=return]` (mDNS for `.local` hostnames, with early exit to avoid false positives), then `resolve` (systemd-resolved for everything else), then `dns` (direct DNS as a fallback).

---

## 2026-03-14 — Package added: `lxappearance`

**`lxappearance`** is the GTK theme, icon, and font configuration tool from the LXDE project. While KIRO uses XFCE4's settings manager for the primary desktop, `lxappearance` is indispensable for configuring GTK appearance in the tiling window manager environments (ohmychadwm, edu-chadwm) where there is no XFCE settings daemon running. Without it, users of those WMs would have no GUI way to change the GTK theme or cursor, and would need to edit `~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini` by hand.

---

## 2025-12-26 — `up.sh` Major Rewrite

The **`up.sh`** daily maintenance script — used to bump the version, refresh the mirrorlist, and prepare each new ISO build — was rewritten from scratch with significantly better engineering:

**Before:** Basic bash script with `set -eo pipefail`, inline code, and a simple toggle variable for mirrorlist fetching.

**After:**

- `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang instead of `#!/bin/bash` — more portable and respects the user's PATH
- `set -Eeuo pipefail` — the `-E` flag ensures ERR traps are inherited by functions and subshells, `-u` treats unset variables as errors (catches typos in variable names), together making the script fail fast and visibly rather than silently producing wrong results
- Dedicated helper functions: `die()`, `info()`, `ensure_paths()`, `write_static_mirrorlist()` — replacing inline code with named functions makes the script readable and testable
- Configurable connection timeouts (`CONNECT_TIMEOUT=5`, `MAX_TIME=20`, `RETRIES=3`) — instead of letting curl hang indefinitely on a slow mirror, these limits ensure the script fails predictably if the network is unavailable
- `trap cleanup EXIT` — a cleanup handler that removes temporary files even if the script exits with an error, preventing stale temp files from accumulating

This rewrite makes the daily build process more reliable, particularly in CI-like environments or when the network is flaky.

---

## 2025-12-21 — Removed `nvidia-dkms` from package list

**`nvidia-dkms`** was removed from `packages.x86_64`. The DKMS version of the NVIDIA driver requires the kernel headers and a build toolchain at install time, and rebuilds the kernel module every time the kernel updates. On a live ISO, this is inappropriate: the ISO cannot know which NVIDIA driver will match the user's card, the build process is slow, and DKMS modules built in the live session do not persist to the installed system. Users with NVIDIA hardware should install the appropriate driver (either `nvidia` or `nvidia-dkms`) after installation via the KIRO hardware detection tooling. The open-source `nouveau` driver (handled via mesa) remains available for basic display output during the live session.

---

## 2026-04-09 — Application Layer Expansion

### New user-facing applications

A substantial set of new packages was added to bring the ISO closer to a complete daily-driver environment:

- **`gcolor3`** — a modern GTK3 color picker with hex, RGB, and HSL output. Useful for design work, theming, and web development. A basic but frequently-needed tool that was absent.
- **`hw-probe`** — uploads hardware probe data to the Linux Hardware Database (`linux-hardware.org`), helping the community track hardware compatibility. Also useful locally as a `lshw`-style diagnostic tool. (Note: an initial typo `hwprobe` was corrected to `hw-probe` in a follow-up commit.)
- **`resources`** — a GNOME-style system monitor with per-process CPU, memory, GPU, and network usage. A modern alternative to the aging `gnome-system-monitor` and more informative than plain `htop` for desktop users.
- **`signal-desktop`** + **`signal-in-tray`** — Signal, the end-to-end encrypted messaging application. Including it in the ISO signals (no pun intended) that privacy is a priority. `signal-in-tray` adds a system tray icon so Signal can run in the background without occupying a taskbar slot.
- **`shortwave`** — an internet radio player with a searchable station database. A lightweight application for background music during work sessions.
- **`spotify`** — the desktop Spotify client for music streaming. While not open-source, it is one of the most commonly requested applications on Linux and including it avoids users having to go through the AUR manually after installation.

### `archlinux-logout` upgraded to GTK4

**`archlinux-logout-git`** was replaced with **`archlinux-logout-gtk4-git`**, the actively maintained GTK4 port of the ArcoLinux logout dialog. The GTK3 version is no longer developed. The GTK4 version is visually identical but built on the modern toolkit, ensuring compatibility with current GNOME and GTK theming systems.

### Build script improvements

Two fixes landed in **`build-the-iso.sh`**:

1. **`set -e` re-enabled** — the `set -e` flag (exit on error) had been commented out with `#set -e`. This meant build failures could be silently swallowed and the script would continue in a broken state, potentially producing a corrupt ISO. Re-enabling it makes the build fail loudly and immediately when something goes wrong.

2. **`installed_dir` path detection fixed** — the previous method used `dirname $(readlink -f $(basename pwd))`, which is unreliable: `basename pwd` just returns the directory name without a path, so `readlink -f` was resolving relative to the current directory in an unpredictable way. The replacement `"$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)/.."` is a standard idiom that correctly resolves the script's parent directory regardless of how or from where the script is invoked.

---

## 2026-04-05 — Window Manager Package Additions

Several packages needed by the tiling window manager environments (ohmychadwm, edu-chadwm) were added:

- **`fastcompmgr-git`** — a lightweight X11 compositor forked from `compton`. While `picom` is used for the main chadwm setup, `fastcompmgr` is an alternative that some chadwm configurations prefer for its lower overhead on older hardware.
- **`maim`** — a screenshot tool designed as a modern replacement for `scrot`. It supports region selection, window selection, and piping output to other tools. Used by chadwm keybindings for quick screenshots.
- **`octopi`** — a Qt5 graphical frontend for pacman. Provides a package manager GUI for users who prefer not to use the terminal for package operations. Important for the live ISO where new users may be evaluating the system.
- **`redshift`** — adjusts the screen's color temperature based on time of day (warmer/orange at night, neutral during the day). Reduces eye strain during extended sessions. Unlike `f.lux`, Redshift is fully open-source and integrates cleanly with both X11 and Wayland.
- **`xautolock`** — automatically locks the screen after a configurable idle timeout. The chadwm setups use `xautolock` + `i3lock` (or similar) to implement session locking, since there is no desktop environment managing this automatically.
- **`xclip`** — a command-line clipboard interface. Used heavily in chadwm dotfiles for copy/paste operations in scripts (e.g., copying a color hex code from `gcolor3` into a config file).
- **`autorandr`** was removed — it was present in the chadwm package section but is not used by any of the window manager configurations in the ISO. `autorandr` is a tool for automatically applying monitor layout profiles, a function that is handled by `arandr` (which is already in the list) for interactive use and by `xrandr` scripts for programmatic use.

---

## 2025-06-19 — Personal Repository Support

A local **`personal_repo`** infrastructure was added for hosting custom or private packages that should not go into the public Chaotic-AUR:

- **`pacman.conf`** — a `[personal_repo]` section was added, pointing to a local database file. This allows the ISO build system to install packages from a local repo during the build, without those packages needing to be available on the internet.
- **`updaterepo.sh`** — a helper script that rebuilds the local repository database using `repo-add`. Run after adding a new `.pkg.tar.zst` to the repo directory.
- **`kiro-dummy-git`** — a placeholder package used to test that the personal repo infrastructure is working before real packages are added.
- Initial database and files binaries included to bootstrap the repo structure.

This feature allows KIRO-specific packages (branding assets, configuration packages, proprietary binaries) to be installed without publishing them to a public repository.

---

## 2025-06-17 — Installation Scripts Refactor

The scripts used to set up Chaotic-AUR on a freshly installed system were rewritten and consolidated:

### `get-pacman-repos-keys-and-mirrors.sh` — complete rewrite

The new script replaced both the old `get-the-keys-and-mirrors-chaotic-aur.sh` and `get-the-keys-and-mirrors-arcolinux.sh` with a single, unified script. Key improvements:

- **ANSI color output** — progress steps, warnings, and errors are now color-coded, making it immediately obvious when something goes wrong vs. completing successfully
- **`set -euo pipefail`** — the script now fails fast on any error rather than continuing in a broken state. The `-u` flag catches undefined variable references (typos in variable names), and `pipefail` ensures errors in piped commands are not masked
- **Dynamic Chaotic-AUR package URL fetching** — instead of hardcoding the URL of the Chaotic-AUR keyring and mirrorlist packages, the script now fetches the current package URL dynamically from the Chaotic-AUR CDN. This means the script continues to work even when the Chaotic-AUR team updates their package versioning scheme
- **Error handling** — each major step (key import, mirrorlist installation, pacman.conf editing) now has explicit error handling and user-readable failure messages

### `install-yay-or-paru.sh` added

A new script for bootstrapping an AUR helper (either `yay` or `paru`) was added. AUR helpers are not available in the official Arch repositories, so installing one requires a manual `git clone` + `makepkg` process. This script automates that process, detecting which helper the user prefers and handling the bootstrap from scratch.

### `pacman.conf` added to installation scripts

A template **`pacman.conf`** was added to the `installation-scripts/` directory for use as a reference during post-install setup, pre-configured with the Chaotic-AUR repository block.

---

## 2025-05-29 — ArcoLinux Cleanup and Simplification

A focused cleanup pass removed ArcoLinux-specific infrastructure that was no longer needed:

### Scripts removed

- **`arcolinux-snapper`** — ArcoLinux's BTRFS snapshot helper. KIRO does not mandate BTRFS, so this script was unused and confusing to have present.
- **Installation flag files** (`chaotics-repo`, `no-chaotics-repo`, `personal-repo`) — these were marker files used by the ArcoLinux build system to conditionally include repositories. The KIRO build system handles this differently, and these files served no function.

### `pacman.conf` cleaned up

The ISO's embedded `pacman.conf` had several commented-out sections referencing the ArcoLinux and Kiro package repositories from earlier development iterations. These were removed, leaving only the active repository configuration (Chaotic-AUR + optional `personal_repo`). Commented-out repository blocks are confusing because they imply the repositories exist and could be uncommented, when in reality they are stale references.

### Syslinux boot menu simplified

The `archiso_sys-linux.cfg` (syslinux boot configuration) was stripped down to a single, clean boot entry. The original ArcoLinux config had multiple boot options (safe mode, various kernel parameters), most of which were not relevant to KIRO and added visual noise to the BIOS boot menu. A single, well-labeled default entry is cleaner and reduces the chance of a user accidentally booting with the wrong parameters.

### GRUB simplified; `grub` package added

The GRUB boot menu entries were similarly reduced, and the `grub` package itself was added to `packages.x86_64`. This ensures the installed system has GRUB available for configuration after installation, and that the live session's boot menu is clean and minimal.

### `virtual-machine-check.service` removed

This service — inherited from ArcoLinux — detected whether the system was running inside a VM and applied VM-specific tweaks at boot. Removing it was the right call: the service added boot time, and any VM-specific configuration should be handled by the VM guest additions packages (`open-vm-tools`, `virtualbox-guest-utils`) rather than a custom detection service.

### `build-the-iso.sh` simplified

Three outdated lines in the build script that referenced ArcoLinux-specific paths and logic were removed, simplifying the build flow.

---

## 2025-05-23 — Package List Expansion

The ISO package list received a major expansion, shifting from a minimal configuration to a more complete daily-driver environment:

### Applications added

- **`chromium`** — the open-source Chromium browser, complementing the existing Firefox install. Having both browsers available is useful for web development testing and for users who prefer Chromium's lower memory overhead compared to Chrome.
- **`gimp`** — the GNU Image Manipulation Program. Essential for any image editing work, from quick photo corrections to full compositing.
- **`inkscape`** — vector graphics editor. Pairs with GIMP for a complete open-source graphics workflow.
- **`meld`** — a visual diff and merge tool. Invaluable for comparing config files, reviewing patches, and resolving merge conflicts. Much more approachable than `diff` for users who prefer a GUI.
- **`nitrogen`** — a lightweight wallpaper manager for X11. Used by the chadwm environments to set the desktop background (XFCE4 handles this through its own settings manager).
- **`qbittorrent`** — a clean, Qt-based torrent client. Useful for downloading Arch-based ISO files, large open-source archives, and similar content.
- **`scrot`** — a command-line screenshot tool. Used in various keyboard shortcut bindings in the window manager configs.
- **`vlc`** — the VLC media player. Handles virtually every audio and video format without requiring additional codec packages.
- **`variety`** — a wallpaper changer that can download images from Flickr, NASA APOD, Reddit, and other sources on a schedule. Keeps the desktop visually fresh.
- **`simplescreenrecorder-qt6-git`** — a screen recorder with an intuitive GUI. The Qt6 build is preferred over the older Qt5 version for better HiDPI support and compatibility with modern display systems.

### Utilities added

- **`galculator`** — a scientific calculator with both standard and expression modes, GTK-based
- **`arandr`** — a graphical frontend for `xrandr` for managing monitor arrangements; essential for multi-monitor setups
- **`baobab`** — a disk usage visualizer (GNOME Disk Usage Analyzer). Makes it easy to identify what is consuming storage on a system being evaluated for installation
- **`gnome-screenshot`** — screenshot tool with timed capture and area selection

### Packages removed

- **`arc-gtk-theme`** — removed in favor of the `edu-arc-dawn-git` branded theme (already in the list)
- Several ArcoLinux font packages — these were ArcoLinux-branded font collections that served no purpose in a KIRO system

---

## 2025-04-29 — Versioning and Repository Infrastructure

### `change-version.sh` added

A dedicated script for bumping the ISO version across all files that embed it was added. Without this, version bumping requires manually editing `dev-rel`, `profiledef.sh`, `build-the-iso.sh`, and potentially other files — an error-prone process that inevitably leads to version mismatches. `change-version.sh` updates all of these in a single operation.

### `up.sh` added

The **`up.sh`** script was introduced as the daily maintenance helper. Running it refreshes the mirrorlist and calls `change-version.sh` to bump the date-based version string, preparing the working tree for a new build. This script is the single entry point for the daily rebuild cycle.

### `pacman.conf.kiro` added

An alternate `pacman.conf` variant was added for reference and comparison purposes. This gives a clear record of the intended final-state pacman configuration separate from the working `pacman.conf`, making it easier to diff what changed during troubleshooting.

### `linux-zen.preset` removed

Support for the Zen kernel was dropped. The Zen kernel is a performance-tuned variant, but maintaining a separate initramfs preset for it adds complexity. The CachyOS kernel (via Chaotic-AUR) better serves the performance tuning use case for the KIRO audience and does not require a separate preset in the ISO configuration.

### `pacman.conf` — Chaotic-AUR added

The **Chaotic-AUR** repository was added to the ISO's embedded `pacman.conf`. Chaotic-AUR is a binary repository that mirrors the most popular AUR packages as pre-built binaries, eliminating the need to compile from source. This is critical for the KIRO ISO because many of the tools in the package list (edu-* packages, window manager components, several AUR applications) are only available through Chaotic-AUR. Without it, the package list would be dramatically reduced or build times would become impractical.

## 2025-04-27 — Initial Commit

The KIRO ISO project was bootstrapped from an ArcoLinux base. This initial commit established the complete repository structure:

### ISO Configuration (`archiso/`)

The full `airootfs/` overlay was included — 93 files comprising the complete file system overlay that gets merged over the base Arch Linux system during ISO creation. This includes:

- All systemd service enablement symlinks for: SDDM (display manager), NetworkManager, Bluetooth, Avahi (mDNS), and CUPS (printing)
- Base configuration files for the shell, editor, and system
- The initial package list (`packages.x86_64`) — a comprehensive selection covering the full XFCE4 desktop, chadwm/ohmychadwm tiling window managers, development tools, multimedia applications, and system utilities

### Boot Configuration

- **GRUB** — EFI boot entries with standard, NVIDIA-nomodeset, and no-KMS options
- **Syslinux** — BIOS legacy boot configuration
- **systemd-boot** — EFI loader entries for modern UEFI systems

The three-bootloader setup ensures the ISO is bootable on any x86_64 system regardless of firmware type.

### Desktop Environments

Three desktop environments were configured from the start:

- **XFCE4** — the primary, full-featured desktop for users who want a traditional DE experience
- **chadwm** (later renamed `edu-chadwm`) — a customized build of dwm (suckless window manager) with a curated patch set for a practical tiling workflow
- **ohmychadwm** — a more opinionated chadwm configuration with additional visual polish

### Build System

**`installation-scripts/40-build-the-iso.sh`** (465 lines) — the main build automation script that orchestrates the ArchISO build process: validating the environment, installing build dependencies, calling `mkarchiso`, and packaging the output.

**`setup-git-v5.sh`** — the developer environment setup script (later renamed to `setup.sh`) that configures git, SSH keys, and other developer prerequisites.
